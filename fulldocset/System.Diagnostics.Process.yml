  summary: "Provides access to local and remote processes and enables you to start and stop local system processes.       To browse the .NET Framework source code for this type, see the [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System/services/monitoring/system/diagnosticts/Process.cs#f8b2e604d6f1fe04)."
  remarks: "> [!NOTE]\n>  To view the .NET Framework source code for this type, see the [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System/services/monitoring/system/diagnosticts/Process.cs#f8b2e604d6f1fe04). You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).  \n  \n A Process component provides access to a process that is running on a computer. A process, in the simplest terms, is a running app. A thread is the basic unit to which the operating system allocates processor time. A thread can execute any part of the code of the process, including parts currently being executed by another thread.  \n  \n The Process component is a useful tool for starting, stopping, controlling, and monitoring apps. You can use the Process component, to obtain a list of the processes that are running, or you can start a new process. A Process component is used to access system processes. After a Process component has been initialized, it can be used to obtain information about the running process. Such information includes the set of threads, the loaded modules (.dll and .exe files), and performance information such as the amount of memory the process is using.  \n  \n This type implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. When you have finished using the type, you should dispose of it either directly or indirectly. To dispose of the type directly, call its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method in a `try`/`catch` block. To dispose of it indirectly, use a language construct such as `using` (in C#) or `Using` (in Visual Basic). For more information, see the “Using an Object that Implements IDisposable” section in the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface topic.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  32-bit processes cannot access the modules of a 64-bit process. If you try to get information about a 64-bit process from a 32-bit process, you will get a <xref:System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception> exception. A 64-bit process, on the other hand, can access the modules of a 32-bit process.  \n  \n The process component obtains information about a group of properties all at once. After the Process component has obtained information about one member of any group, it will cache the values for the other properties in that group and not obtain new information about the other members of the group until you call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Refresh%2A> method. Therefore, a property value is not guaranteed to be any newer than the last call to the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Refresh%2A> method. The group breakdowns are operating-system dependent.  \n  \n If you have a path variable declared in your system using quotes, you must fully qualify that path when starting any process found in that location. Otherwise, the system will not find the path. For example, if `c:\\mypath` is not in your path, and you add it using quotation marks: `path = %path%;\"c:\\mypath\"`, you must fully qualify any process in `c:\\mypath` when starting it.  \n  \n A system process is uniquely identified on the system by its process identifier. Like many Windows resources, a process is also identified by its handle, which might not be unique on the computer. A handle is the generic term for an identifier of a resource. The operating system persists the process handle, which is accessed through the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Handle%2A> property of the Process component, even when the process has exited. Thus, you can get the process's administrative information, such as the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.ExitCode%2A> (usually either zero for success or a nonzero error code) and the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.ExitTime%2A>. Handles are an extremely valuable resource, so leaking handles is more virulent than leaking memory.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This class contains a link demand and an inheritance demand at the class level that applies to all members. A <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> is thrown when either the immediate caller or the derived class does not have full-trust permission. For details about security demands, see [Link Demands](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"Core\"></a>   \n## [!INCLUDE[net_core](~/add/includes/net-core-md.md)] Notes  \n In the .NET Framework on the desktop, the Process class by default uses <xref:System.Console> encodings, which are typically code page encodings, for the input, output, and error streams. For example code, on systems whose culture is English (United States), code page 437 is the default encoding for the <xref:System.Console> class. However, [!INCLUDE[net_core](~/add/includes/net-core-md.md)] may make only a limited subset of these encodings available. If this is the case, it uses <xref:System.Text.Encoding.UTF8%2A?displayProperty=fullName> as the default encoding.  \n  \n If a Process object depends on specific code page encodings, you can still make them available by doing the following *before* you call any Process methods:  \n  \n1.  Add a reference to the System.Text.Encoding.CodePages.dll assembly to your project.  \n  \n2.  Retrieve the <xref:System.Text.EncodingProvider> object from the <xref:System.Text.CodePagesEncodingProvider.Instance%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  \n  \n3.  Pass the <xref:System.Text.EncodingProvider> object to the <xref:System.Text.Encoding.RegisterProvider%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to make the additional encodings supported by the encoding provider available.  \n  \n The Process class will then automatically use the default system encoding rather than UTF8, provided that you have registered the encoding provider before calling any Process methods."

  summary: "Initializes a new instance of the <xref href=&quot;System.Diagnostics.Process&quot;></xref> class."
  remarks: "If you do not specify the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.MachineName%2A> property, the default is the local computer, (&quot;.&quot;).       You have two options for associating a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component with a process on the computer. The first option is to use the constructor to create the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component, set the appropriate members of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property and call <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> to associate the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> with a new system process. The second option is to associate the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> with a running system process by using <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcessById%2A> or one of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcesses%2A> return values.       If you use a `static` overload of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method to start a new system process, the method creates a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component and associates it with the process.       When the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property is set to its default value, `true`, you can start applications and documents in a way that is similar to using the `Run` dialog box of the Windows `Start` menu. When <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A?displayProperty=fullName> is `false`, you can start only executables.       Any executable file that you can call from the command line can be started in one of two ways: by setting the appropriate members of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property and calling the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method with no parameters, or by passing the appropriate parameter to the `static`<xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> member.       You can create a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component by using the constructor, one of the static <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> overloads, or any of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcessById%2A>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcesses%2A>, or <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcessesByName%2A> methods. After you have done so, you have a view into the associated process. This is not a dynamic view that updates itself automatically when the process properties have changed in memory. Instead, you must call <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Refresh%2A> for the component to update the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> property information in your application."

  summary: "Gets the base priority of the associated process."
  remarks: "The BasePriority of the process is the starting priority for threads created within the associated process. You can view information about the base priority through the System Monitor&quot;s Priority Base counter.       Based on the time elapsed or other boosts, the operating system can change the base priority when a process should be placed ahead of others.       The BasePriority property lets you view the starting priority assigned to a process. However, because it is read-only, you cannot use the BasePriority to set the priority of the process. To change the priority, use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.PriorityClass%2A> property. The BasePriority is viewable using the System Monitor, while the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.PriorityClass%2A> is not. Both the BasePriority and the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.PriorityClass%2A> can be viewed programmatically.

  summary: "Closes a process that has a user interface by sending a close message to its main window."
  remarks: "When a process is executing, its message loop is in a wait state. The message loop executes every time a Windows message is sent to the process by the operating system. Calling CloseMainWindow sends a request to close to the main window, which, in a well-formed application, closes child windows and revokes all running message loops for the application. The request to exit the process by calling CloseMainWindow does not force the application to quit. The application can ask for user verification before quitting, or it can refuse to quit. To force the application to quit, use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Kill%2A> method. The behavior of CloseMainWindow is identical to that of a user closing an application&quot;s main window using the system menu. Therefore, the request to exit the process by closing the main window does not force the application to quit immediately.       Data edited by the process or resources allocated to the process can be lost if you call <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Kill%2A>. <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Kill%2A> causes an abnormal process termination, and should be used only when necessary. CloseMainWindow enables an orderly termination of the process and closes all windows, so it is preferable for applications with an interface. If CloseMainWindow fails, you can use <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Kill%2A> to terminate the process. <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Kill%2A> is the only way to terminate processes that do not have graphical interfaces.       You can call <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Kill%2A> and CloseMainWindow only for processes that are running on the local computer. You cannot cause processes on remote computers to exit. You can only view information for processes running on remote computers."

  summary: "Gets or sets whether the <xref href=&quot;System.Diagnostics.Process.Exited&quot;></xref> event should be raised when the process terminates."
  remarks: "The EnableRaisingEvents property indicates whether the component should be notified when the operating system has shut down a process. The EnableRaisingEvents property is used in asynchronous processing to notify your application that a process has exited. To force your application to synchronously wait for an exit event (which interrupts processing of the application until the exit event has occurred), use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.WaitForExit%2A> method.      > [!NOTE] >  If you are using Visual Studio and double-click a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component in your project, an <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Exited> event delegate and event handler are automatically generated. Additional code sets the EnableRaisingEvents property to `false`. You must change this property to `true` for your event handler to be executed when the associated process exits.       When an associated process exits after being shut down by the operating system either through a normal or abnormal termination, the operating system notifies each process component to which the process was associated, as long as the component&quot;s EnableRaisingEvents value is `true`. If a component started the process, the component can then access the administrative information for the associated process, which is still being stored by the operating system. Such information includes the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.ExitTime%2A>, and the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.ExitCode%2A>.       After the associated process exits, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Handle%2A> of the component no longer points to an existing process resource. Instead, it can be used only to access the operating system&quot;s information about the process resource. The operating system is aware that there are handles to exited processes that have not been released by <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> components, so it keeps the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.ExitTime%2A> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Handle%2A> information in memory.       There is a cost associated with watching for a process to exit. If EnableRaisingEvents is `true`, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Exited> event is raised when the associated process terminates. The procedures that you have specified for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Exited> event run at that time.       Sometimes, your application starts a process but does not need to be notified of its closure. For example, your application can start Notepad to allow the user to perform text editing, but make no further use of the Notepad application. You can choose to not be notified when the process exits, because it is not relevant to the continued operation of your application. Setting EnableRaisingEvents to `false` saves system resources."

If you use the exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that you know the exit code convention used by the application process.       Developers usually indicate a successful exit by an ExitCode value of zero, and designate errors by nonzero values that the calling method can use to identify the cause of an abnormal process termination. It is not necessary to follow these guidelines, but they are the convention.       If you try to get the ExitCode before the process has exited, the attempt throws an exception.

You can request or force the associated process to exit by calling <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.CloseMainWindow%2A> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Kill%2A>. If a handle is open to the process, the operating system releases the process memory when the process has exited, but retains administrative information about the process, such as the handle, exit code, and exit time. To get this information, you can use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.ExitCode%2A> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.ExitTime%2A> properties. These properties are populated automatically for processes that were started by this component. The administrative information is released when all the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> components that are associated with the system process are destroyed and hold no more handles to the exited process.       A process can terminate independently of your code. If you started the process using this component, the system updates the value of HasExited automatically, even if the associated process exits independently.      > [!NOTE] >  When standard output has been redirected to asynchronous event handlers, it is possible that output processing will not have completed when this property returns `true`.

  summary: "Immediately stops the associated process."
  remarks: "Kill forces a termination of the process, while <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.CloseMainWindow%2A> only requests a termination. When a process with a graphical interface is executing, its message loop is in a wait state. The message loop executes every time a Windows message is sent to the process by the operating system. Calling <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.CloseMainWindow%2A> sends a request to close to the main window, which, in a well-formed application, closes child windows and revokes all running message loops for the application. The request to exit the process by calling <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.CloseMainWindow%2A> does not force the application to quit. The application can ask for user verification before quitting, or it can refuse to quit. To force the application to quit, use the Kill method. The behavior of <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.CloseMainWindow%2A> is identical to that of a user closing an application&quot;s main window using the system menu. Therefore, the request to exit the process by closing the main window does not force the application to quit immediately.      > [!NOTE] >  The Kill method executes asynchronously. After calling the Kill method, call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.WaitForExit%2A> method to wait for the process to exit, or check the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.HasExited%2A> property to determine if the process has exited.       Data edited by the process or resources allocated to the process can be lost if you call Kill. Kill causes an abnormal process termination and should be used only when necessary. <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.CloseMainWindow%2A> enables an orderly termination of the process and closes all windows, so it is preferable for applications with an interface.

Calling OnExited causes the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Exited> event to occur and is the only way to raise the event using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component. OnExited is primarily used when deriving classes from the component.       As an alternative to OnExited, you can write your own event handler. You create your own event handler delegate and your own event-handling method.      > [!NOTE] >  If you are using the Visual Studio environment, an event handler delegate (AddOnExited) and an event-handling method (Process1_Exited) are created for you when you drag a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component onto a form and double-click the icon. The code you create to run when the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Exited> event occurs is entered into the Process1_Exited procedure. You do not need to create the OnExited member, because it is implemented for you.       Raising an event invokes the event handler through a delegate.

  summary: "Gets or sets the overall priority category for the associated process."
  remarks: "A process priority class encompasses a range of thread priority levels. Threads with different priorities that are running in the process run relative to the priority class of the process. Win32 uses four priority classes with seven base priority levels per class. These process priority classes are captured in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessPriorityClass> enumeration, which lets you set the process priority to <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessPriorityClass>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessPriorityClass>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessPriorityClass>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessPriorityClass>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessPriorityClass>, or <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessPriorityClass>. Based on the time elapsed or other boosts, the base priority level can be changed by the operating system when a process needs to be put ahead of others for access to the processor. In addition, you can set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.PriorityBoostEnabled%2A> to temporarily boost the priority level of threads that have been taken out of the wait state. The priority is reset when the process returns to the wait state.       The <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BasePriority%2A> property lets you view the starting priority that is assigned to a process. However, because it is read-only, you cannot use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BasePriority%2A> property to set the priority of a process. To change the priority, use the PriorityClass property, which gets or sets the overall priority category for the process.       The priority class cannot be viewed using System Monitor. The following table shows the relationship between the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BasePriority%2A> and PriorityClass values.      |BasePriority|PriorityClass|   |------------------|-------------------|   |4|<xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessPriorityClass>|   |8|<xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessPriorityClass>|   |13|<xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessPriorityClass>|   |24|<xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessPriorityClass>|"

Under heavy system loads, specifying which processor should run a specific thread can improve performance by reducing the number of times the processor cache is reloaded. The association between a processor and a thread is called the processor affinity.       Each processor is represented as a bit. Bit 0 is processor one, bit 1 is processor two, and so forth.

  summary: "Gets a stream used to read the error output of the application."
  remarks: "When a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> writes text to its standard error stream, that text is normally displayed on the console. By redirecting the StandardError stream, you can manipulate or suppress the error output of a process. For example, you can filter the text, format it differently, or write the output to both the console and a designated log file.      > [!NOTE] >  To use StandardError, you must set <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to `false`, and you must set <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.RedirectStandardError%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to `true`. Otherwise, reading from the StandardError stream throws an exception.       The redirected StandardError stream can be read synchronously or asynchronously. Methods such as <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.Read%2A>, <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A>, and <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadToEnd%2A> perform synchronous read operations on the error output stream of the process. These synchronous read operations do not complete until the associated <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> writes to its StandardError stream, or closes the stream.       In contrast, <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginErrorReadLine%2A> starts asynchronous read operations on the StandardError stream. This method enables a designated event handler for the stream output and immediately returns to the caller, which can perform other work while the stream output is directed to the event handler.       Synchronous read operations introduce a dependency between the caller reading from the StandardError stream and the child process writing to that stream. These dependencies can result in deadlock conditions. When the caller reads from the redirected stream of a child process, it is dependent on the child. The caller waits on the read operation until the child writes to the stream or closes the stream. When the child process writes enough data to fill its redirected stream, it is dependent on the parent. The child process waits on the next write operation until the parent reads from the full stream or closes the stream. The deadlock condition results when the caller and child process wait on each other to complete an operation, and neither can proceed. You can avoid deadlocks by evaluating dependencies between the caller and child process.       The following C# code, for example, shows how to read from a redirected stream and wait for the child process to exit.      ```   // Start the child process.    Process p = new Process();    // Redirect the error stream of the child process.    p.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;    p.StartInfo.RedirectStandardError = true;    p.StartInfo.FileName = &quot;Write500Lines.exe&quot;;    p.Start();    // Do not wait for the child process to exit before    // reading to the end of its redirected error stream.    // p.WaitForExit();    // Read the error stream first and then wait.    string error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();    p.WaitForExit();   ```       The code example avoids a deadlock condition by calling `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` before `p.WaitForExit`. A deadlock condition can result if the parent process calls `p.WaitForExit` before `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` and the child process writes enough text to fill the redirected stream. The parent process would wait indefinitely for the child process to exit. The child process would wait indefinitely for the parent to read from the full StandardError stream.       There is a similar issue when you read all text from both the standard output and standard error streams. The following C# code, for example, performs a read operation on both streams.      ```   // Do not perform a synchronous read to the end of both    // redirected streams.   // string output = p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();   // string error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();   // p.WaitForExit();   // Use asynchronous read operations on at least one of the streams.   p.BeginOutputReadLine();   string error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();   p.WaitForExit();   ```       The code example avoids the deadlock condition by performing asynchronous read operations on the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream. A deadlock condition results if the parent process calls `p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd` followed by `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` and the child process writes enough text to fill its error stream. The parent process would wait indefinitely for the child process to close its <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream. The child process would wait indefinitely for the parent to read from the full StandardError stream.       You can use asynchronous read operations to avoid these dependencies and their deadlock potential. Alternately, you can avoid the deadlock condition by creating two threads and reading the output of each stream on a separate thread.      > [!NOTE] >  You cannot mix asynchronous and synchronous read operations on a redirected stream. Once the redirected stream of a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> is opened in either asynchronous or synchronous mode, all further read operations on that stream must be in the same mode. For example, do not follow <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginErrorReadLine%2A> with a call to <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A> on the StandardError stream, or vice versa. However, you can read two different streams in different modes. For example, you can call <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginOutputReadLine%2A> and then call <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A> for the StandardError stream."

  summary: "Gets a stream used to read the textual output of the application."
  remarks: "When a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> writes text to its standard stream, that text is normally displayed on the console. By redirecting the StandardOutput stream, you can manipulate or suppress the output of a process. For example, you can filter the text, format it differently, or write the output to both the console and a designated log file.      > [!NOTE] >  To use StandardOutput, you must set <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to `false`, and you must set <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to `true`. Otherwise, reading from the StandardOutput stream throws an exception.       The redirected StandardOutput stream can be read synchronously or asynchronously. Methods such as <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.Read%2A>, <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A>, and <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadToEnd%2A> perform synchronous read operations on the output stream of the process. These synchronous read operations do not complete until the associated <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> writes to its StandardOutput stream, or closes the stream.       In contrast, <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginOutputReadLine%2A> starts asynchronous read operations on the StandardOutput stream. This method enables a designated event handler for the stream output and immediately returns to the caller, which can perform other work while the stream output is directed to the event handler.       Synchronous read operations introduce a dependency between the caller reading from the StandardOutput stream and the child process writing to that stream. These dependencies can result in deadlock conditions. When the caller reads from the redirected stream of a child process, it is dependent on the child. The caller waits on the read operation until the child writes to the stream or closes the stream. When the child process writes enough data to fill its redirected stream, it is dependent on the parent. The child process waits on the next write operation until the parent reads from the full stream or closes the stream. The deadlock condition results when the caller and child process wait on each other to complete an operation, and neither can proceed. You can avoid deadlocks by evaluating dependencies between the caller and child process.       The following C# code, for example, shows how to read from a redirected stream and wait for the child process to exit.      ```   Process p = new Process();   p.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;   p.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;   p.StartInfo.FileName = &quot;Write500Lines.exe&quot;;   p.Start();      // To avoid deadlocks, always read the output stream first and then wait.   string output = p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();   p.WaitForExit();   ```       The code example avoids a deadlock condition by calling `p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd` before `p.WaitForExit`. A deadlock condition can result if the parent process calls `p.WaitForExit` before `p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd` and the child process writes enough text to fill the redirected stream. The parent process would wait indefinitely for the child process to exit. The child process would wait indefinitely for the parent to read from the full StandardOutput stream.       There is a similar issue when you read all text from both the standard output and standard error streams. The following C# code, for example, performs a read operation on both streams.      ```   // To avoid deadlocks, use asynchronous read operations on at least one of the streams.   // Do not perform a synchronous read to the end of both redirected streams.   p.BeginOutputReadLine();   string error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();   p.WaitForExit();   ```       The code example avoids the deadlock condition by performing asynchronous read operations on the StandardOutput stream. A deadlock condition results if the parent process calls `p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd` followed by `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` and the child process writes enough text to fill its error stream. The parent process would wait indefinitely for the child process to close its StandardOutput stream. The child process would wait indefinitely for the parent to read from the full <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream.       You can use asynchronous read operations to avoid these dependencies and their deadlock potential. Alternately, you can avoid the deadlock condition by creating two threads and reading the output of each stream on a separate thread.      > [!NOTE] >  You cannot mix asynchronous and synchronous read operations on a redirected stream. Once the redirected stream of a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> is opened in either asynchronous or synchronous mode, all further read operations on that stream must be in the same mode. For example, do not follow <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginOutputReadLine%2A> with a call to <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A> on the StandardOutput stream, or vice versa. However, you can read two different streams in different modes. For example, you can call <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginOutputReadLine%2A> and then call <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A> for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream."

  remarks: "Use this overload to start a process resource and associate it with the current <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component. The return value `true` indicates that a new process resource was started. If the process resource specified by the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> member of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property is already running on the computer, no additional process resource is started. Instead, the running process resource is reused and `false` is returned.  \n  \n You can start a ClickOnce application by specifying the location (for example, a Web address) from which you originally installed the application. Do not start a ClickOnce application by specifying its installed location on your hard drive.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If you are using Visual Studio, this overload of the Start method is the one that you insert into your code after you drag a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component onto the designer. Use the `Properties` window to expand the `StartInfo` category and write the appropriate value into the `FileName` property. Your changes will appear in the form's `InitializeComponent` procedure.  \n  \n This overload of Start is not a `static` method. You must call it from an instance of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> class. Before calling Start, you must first specify <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property information for this <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance, because that information is used to determine the process resource to start.  \n  \n The other overloads of the Start method are `static` members. You do not need to create an instance of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component before you call those overloads of the method. Instead, you can call Start for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> class itself, and a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component is created if the process was started. Or, `null` is returned if a process was reused. The process resource is automatically associated with the new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component that is returned by the Start method.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> members can be used to duplicate the functionality of the `Run` dialog box of the Windows `Start` menu. Anything that can be typed into a command line can be started by setting the appropriate values in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property. The only <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property that must be set is the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property. The <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property does not have to be an executable file. It can be of any file type for which the extension has been associated with an application that is installed on the system. For example, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property can have a .txt extension if you have associated text files with an editor, such as Notepad, or it can have a .doc extension if you have associated.doc files with a word processing tool, such as Microsoft Word.  \n  \n In the command line, you can specify actions to take for certain types of files. For example, you can print documents or edit text files. Specify these actions using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Verb%2A> member of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property. For other types of files, you can specify command-line arguments when you start the file from the `Run` dialog box. For example, you can pass a URL as an argument if you specify your browser as the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A>. These arguments can be specified in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property's <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Arguments%2A> member.  \n  \n If you have a path variable declared in your system using quotes, you must fully qualify that path when starting any process found in that location. Otherwise, the system will not find the path. For example, if `c:\\mypath` is not in your path, and you add it using quotation marks: `path = %path%;\"c:\\mypath\"`, you must fully qualify any process in `c:\\mypath` when starting it.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  ASP.NET Web page and server control code executes in the context of the ASP.NET worker process on the Web server.  If you use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method in an ASP.NET Web page or server control, the new process executes on the Web server with restricted permissions. The process does not start in the same context as the client browser, and does not have access to the user desktop.  \n  \n Whenever you use Start to start a process, you might need to close it or you risk losing system resources. Close processes using <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.CloseMainWindow%2A> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Kill%2A>. You can check whether a process has already been closed by using its <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.HasExited%2A> property.  \n  \n A note about apartment states in managed threads is necessary here. When <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A> is `true` on the process component's <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property, make sure you have set a threading model on your application by setting the attribute `[STAThread]` on the `main()` method. Otherwise, a managed thread can be in an `unknown` state or put in the `MTA` state, the latter of which conflicts with <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A> being `true`. Some methods require that the apartment state not be `unknown`. If the state is not explicitly set, when the application encounters such a method, it defaults to `MTA`, and once set, the apartment state cannot be changed. However, `MTA` causes an exception to be thrown when the operating system shell is managing the thread."

The overload associates the resource with a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> object.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If the address of the executable file to start is a URL, the process is not started and `null` is returned.  \n  \n This overload lets you start a process without first creating a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance. The overload is an alternative to the explicit steps of creating a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance, setting the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> member of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property, and calling <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance.  \n  \n You can start a ClickOnce application by setting the `fileName` parameter to the location (for example, a Web address) from which you originally installed the application. Do not start a ClickOnce application by specifying its installed location on your hard drive.  \n  \n Starting a process by specifying its file name is similar to typing the information in the `Run` dialog box of the Windows `Start` menu. Therefore, the file name does not need to represent an executable file. It can be of any file type for which the extension has been associated with an application installed on the system. For example the file name can have a .txt extension if you have associated text files with an editor, such as Notepad, or it can have a .doc if you have associated.doc files with a word processing tool, such as Microsoft Word. Similarly, in the same way that the `Run` dialog box can accept an executable file name with or without the .exe extension, the .exe extension is optional in the `fileName` parameter. For example, you can set the `fileName` parameter to either \"Notepad.exe\" or \"Notepad\".  \n  \n This overload does not allow command-line arguments for the process. If you need to specify one or more command-line arguments for the process, use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%28System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo%29?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%28System.String%2CSystem.String%29?displayProperty=fullName> overloads.  \n  \n Unlike the other overloads, the overload of <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> that has no parameters is not a `static` member. Use that overload when you have already created a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance, specified start information (including the file name), and want to start a process resource and associate it with the existing <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance. Use one of the `static` overloads when you want to create a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component rather than start a process for an existing component. Both this overload and the overload that has no parameters allow you to specify the file name of the process resource to start.  \n  \n If you have a path variable declared in your system using quotes, you must fully qualify that path when starting any process found in that location. Otherwise, the system will not find the path. For example, if `c:\\mypath` is not in your path, and you add it using quotation marks: `path = %path%;\"c:\\mypath\"`, you must fully qualify any process in `c:\\mypath` when starting it.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  ASP.NET Web page and server control code executes in the context of the ASP.NET worker process on the Web server.  If you use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method in an ASP.NET Web page or server control, the new process executes on the Web server with restricted permissions. The process does not start in the same context as the client browser, and does not have access to the user desktop.  \n  \n Whenever you use <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> to start a process, you might need to close it or you risk losing system resources. Close processes using <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.CloseMainWindow%2A> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Kill%2A>. You can check whether a process has already been closed by using its <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.HasExited%2A> property.  \n  \n A note about apartment states in managed threads is necessary here. When <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A> is `true` on the process component's <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property, make sure you have set a threading model on your application by setting the attribute `[STAThread]` on the `main()` method. Otherwise, a managed thread can be in an `unknown` state or put in the `MTA` state, the latter of which conflicts with <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A> being `true`. Some methods require that the apartment state not be `unknown`. If the state is not explicitly set, when the application encounters such a method, it defaults to `MTA`, and once set, the apartment state cannot be changed.

  remarks: "StartInfo represents the set of parameters to use to start a process. When <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> is called, the StartInfo is used to specify the process to start. The only necessary StartInfo member to set is the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property. Starting a process by specifying the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property is similar to typing the information in the **Run** dialog box of the Windows **Start** menu. Therefore, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property does not need to represent an executable file. It can be of any file type for which the extension has been associated with an application installed on the system. For example the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> can have a .txt extension if you have associated text files with an editor, such as Notepad, or it can have a .doc if you have associated.doc files with a word processing tool, such as Microsoft Word. Similarly, in the same way that the **Run** dialog box can accept an executable file name with or without the .exe extension, the .exe extension is optional in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> member. For example, you can set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property to either &quot;Notepad.exe&quot; or &quot;Notepad&quot;.       You can start a ClickOnce application by setting the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property to the location (for example, a Web address) from which you originally installed the application. Do not start a ClickOnce application by specifying its installed location on your hard drive.       If the file name involves a nonexecutable file, such as a .doc file, you can include a verb specifying what action to take on the file. For example, you could set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Verb%2A> to &quot;Print&quot; for a file ending in the .doc extension. The file name specified in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property does not need to have an extension if you manually enter a value for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Verb%2A> property. However, if you use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Verbs%2A> property to determine what verbs are available, you must include the extension.       You can change the parameters specified in the StartInfo property up to the time that you call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method on the process. After you start the process, changing the StartInfo values does not affect or restart the associated process. If you call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%28System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo%29> method with the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UserName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Password%2A?displayProperty=fullName> properties set, the unmanaged `CreateProcessWithLogonW` function is called, which starts the process in a new window even if the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.CreateNoWindow%2A> property value is `true` or the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.WindowStyle%2A> property value is <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessWindowStyle>.       If you did not use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method to start a process, the StartInfo property does not reflect the parameters used to start the process. For example, if you use <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcesses%2A> to get an array of processes running on the computer, the StartInfo property of each <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> does not contain the original file name or arguments used to start the process.       When the process is started, the file name is the file that populates the (read-only) <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.MainModule%2A> property. If you want to retrieve the executable file that is associated with the process after the process has started, use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.MainModule%2A> property. If you want to set the executable file of a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance for which an associated process has not been started, use the StartInfo property&quot;s <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> member. Because the members of the StartInfo property are arguments that are passed to the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method of a process, changing the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property after the associated process has started will not reset the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.MainModule%2A> property. These properties are used only to initialize the associated process."

This state is useful, for example, when your application needs to wait for a starting process to finish creating its main window before the application communicates with that window.       If a process does not have a message loop, WaitForInputIdle throws an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException>.       The WaitForInputIdle overload instructs the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component to wait indefinitely for the process to become idle in the message loop. This instruction can cause an application to stop responding. For example, if the process is written to always exit its message loop immediately, as in the code fragment `while(true)`."

  remarks: "Use WaitForInputIdle to force the processing of your application to wait until the message loop has returned to the idle state. When a process with a user interface is executing, its message loop executes every time a Windows message is sent to the process by the operating system. The process then returns to the message loop. A process is said to be in an idle state when it is waiting for messages inside of a message loop. This state is useful, for example, when your application needs to wait for a starting process to finish creating its main window before the application communicates with that window.       If a process does not have a message loop, WaitForInputIdle throws an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException>.       The WaitForInputIdle overload instructs the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component to wait a finite amount of time for the process to become idle in the message loop. If the associated process has not become idle by the end of the interval because the loop is still processing messages, `false` is returned to the calling procedure.
