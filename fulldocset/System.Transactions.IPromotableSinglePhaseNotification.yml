  type: Interface
  summary: "Describes an object that acts as a commit delegate for a non-distributed transaction internal to a resource manager."
  remarks: "Promotable Enlistments (PSPE) allow a resource, such as a database, to take ownership of the transaction if it is the only entity participating in the transaction. Later, if needed, the <xref:System.Transactions> infrastructure can still escalate the transaction to MSDTC. For more information, see [Optimization Using Single Phase Commit and Promotable Single Phase Notification](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/653d51d1-b4bf-4e34-9a6f-aec073f0f5bb).       A resource manager that implements this interface delegates control of the commit of it&quot;s internal non-distributed transaction to an enlistment on a <xref:System.Transactions> transaction through the <xref:System.Transactions.Transaction.EnlistPromotableSinglePhase%2A> method on the <xref:System.Transactions.Transaction> class.       If the <xref:System.Transactions.ITransactionPromoter.Promote%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method is called, your implementation of this interface must produce a distributed transaction in the form of a propagation token, and return it to <xref:System.Transactions>.       After you enlist an object that implements this interface as a participant of a transaction using the <xref:System.Transactions.Transaction.EnlistPromotableSinglePhase%2A> method, the transaction manager then notifies the participant when the transaction is promoted, committed, or rolled back by invoking the <xref:System.Transactions.ITransactionPromoter.Promote%2A> method, the <xref:System.Transactions.IPromotableSinglePhaseNotification.SinglePhaseCommit%2A> method, or the <xref:System.Transactions.IPromotableSinglePhaseNotification.Rollback%2A> method of the object.       For more information, see [Optimization Using Single Phase Commit and Promotable Single Phase Notification](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/653d51d1-b4bf-4e34-9a6f-aec073f0f5bb)."

  summary: "Notifies an enlisted object that the transaction is being committed."
  remarks: "This method notifies an enlisted object that the transaction is to be committed.       The `singlePhaseEnlistment` parameters contain callbacks that allow the implementation of this interface to notify the transaction manager of the outcome of the transaction, since the transaction manager has delegated control of the transaction. In the case of a promoted transaction, the transaction manager listens to the transaction outcome and overrides the response being sent.       On receiving this notification, the resource manager should attempt to commit it&quot;s internal transaction (or the distributed transaction if it has been escalated), and invoke one of the callback methods on the `singlePhaseEnlistment` parameter based on the outcome of committing it&quot;s transaction."
