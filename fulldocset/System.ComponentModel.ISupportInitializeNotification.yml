  summary: "Allows coordination of initialization for a component and its dependent properties."
  remarks: "You should implement this interface when your component has initialization dependencies on other components that also implement the ISupportInitializeNotification interface. You can check to see if the dependent components have completed initialization by checking the <xref:System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitializeNotification.IsInitialized%2A> property.       ISupportInitializeNotification is implemented by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListControl> types."

  summary: "Occurs when initialization of the component is completed."
  remarks: "This event typically occurs during the call to the <xref:System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize.EndInit%2A> method for the component, but it may occur later if the component has dependent controls that implement the <xref:System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitializeNotification> interface and the dependent controls have not completed initialization.
