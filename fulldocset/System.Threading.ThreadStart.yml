  summary: "Represents the method that executes on a <xref href=&quot;System.Threading.Thread&quot;></xref>."
  remarks: "When a managed thread is created, the method that executes on the thread is represented by a ThreadStart delegate or a <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart> delegate that is passed to the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.%23ctor%2A> constructor. The thread does not begin executing until the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Start%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method is called. Execution begins at the first line of the method represented by the ThreadStart or <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart> delegate.      > [!NOTE] >  Visual Basic and C# users can omit the ThreadStart or <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart> delegate constructor when creating a thread. In Visual Basic, use the `AddressOf` operator when passing your method to the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.%23ctor%2A> constructor; for example, `Dim t As New Thread(AddressOf ThreadProc)`. In C#, simply specify the name of the thread procedure. The compiler selects the correct delegate constructor.       [C++]      > [!NOTE] >  In version 2.0 of the .NET Framework, creating a ThreadStart delegate for a static method in C++ requires only one parameter: the address of the callback method, qualified by the class name. In earlier versions two parameters were required when creating a delegate for a static method: zero (null) and the method address. For an instance method, all versions require two parameters: the instance variable and the method address."
  example:
  - "The following code example shows the syntax for creating and using a ThreadStart delegate with an instance method and with a static method.  \n  \n For another simple example that demonstrates how to create a ThreadStart delegate, see the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Start?displayProperty=fullName> method overload. For more information about thread creation, see [Creating Threads and Passing Data at Start Time](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.Threading.ThreadStart2#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.threading.threa_6_1.cpp)]\n [!code-cs[System.Threading.ThreadStart2#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.threading.threa_6_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[System.Threading.ThreadStart2#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.threading.threa_6_1.vb)]"
