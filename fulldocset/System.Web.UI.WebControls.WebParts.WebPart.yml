  summary: "Serves as the base class for custom ASP.NET Web Parts controls, adding to the base <xref href=&quot;System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part&quot;></xref> class features some additional user interface (UI) properties, the ability to create connections, and personalization behavior."
  remarks: "When you create controls with Web Parts functionality, you have two basic options. You can create custom controls that derive from the WebPart class, or you can create or use other server controls. Existing ASP.NET controls, custom server controls, and user controls can all be given full Web Parts functionality by declaring them within (or adding them programmatically to) a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> zone control, with the result that they will be wrapped with <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> objects at run time and treated as true WebPart controls. For details, see the documentation for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> class. For speed of development and maximum reuse of code, using existing server controls can be a good option. For maximum programmatic control over the behavior and Web Parts functionality of controls, creating a custom control that inherits from the WebPart class is often the best option.       The abstract WebPart class inherits from the base <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part> control and provides the basic elements for all WebPart controls. The class includes a common set of properties that affect the appearance of the UI. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AllowClose%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AllowConnect%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AllowEdit%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AllowHide%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AllowMinimize%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AllowZoneChange%2A> properties each specify whether the user of a Web application is permitted to interact with the part control in the way indicated by the given property name. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.CatalogIconImageUrl%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ChromeState%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ChromeType%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Description%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Height%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.HelpUrl%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Hidden%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Title%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.TitleIconImageUrl%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.TitleUrl%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Width%2A> properties determine the size, visibility, appearance, and supporting content (such as a title and a description) for a WebPart control.       The relationship of a WebPart control to its context within the Web Parts control set is determined by properties such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.WebPartManager%2A>, which holds a reference to the control&quot;s associated <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> object, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Zone%2A>, which references the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> that contains the control. There can be only one <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control per page, and each instance of a WebPart control can reside within only one <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> at a time.      > [!NOTE] >  A WebPart control can be placed outside of a zone on a Web page, but in this case it functions as a normal server control and loses nearly all Web Parts functionality.       Several other important properties affect unique features of WebPart controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property allows developers to set an arbitrary string that can be used as a filter at run time to determine whether a control is added to the page. Used together with a feature such as role management, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property provides a useful mechanism for creating views based on defined user roles. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ExportMode%2A> property indicates whether, during an export, all the available property data on a control is exported, or only the non-sensitive data. This allows developers to distinguish between data that is sensitive and data that is not, for security purposes. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.WebBrowsableObject%2A> property returns a reference to an instance of a WebPart control, so that an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> control can edit it when the page is in edit mode. Finally, there are several properties that indicate the status of the control relative to the rest of the page. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.IsClosed%2A> property indicates whether a control is closed (and thus added to a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PageCatalogPart> object), or if it is open and available on the page. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.IsShared%2A> property indicates whether a control is a shared control (versus a user-specific control), meaning that it is visible to all users of a Web page. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.IsStandalone%2A> property indicates whether a control is currently contained in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase>-derived zone (such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone>). A value of `false` indicates the control is inside a zone and thus has full Web Parts functionality. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.IsStatic%2A> property indicates whether a control is static or dynamic. A static control is declared in the markup of a Web page, whereas a dynamic control is added programmatically.       The WebPart class also provides several methods that determine what happens at various points in the control&quot;s life cycle. For example, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.OnConnectModeChanged%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.OnEditModeChanged%2A> methods can both be overridden in a derived class to provide programmatic control over the rendering of a control&quot;s contents during the event that corresponds to each method&quot;s name.       Classes that derive from WebPart can add <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartVerb> objects to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Verbs%2A> collection. The verbs are rendered in a verbs menu, which appears in the title bar of a WebPart control. <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartVerb> objects provide simple UI elements for common user actions such as hiding or minimizing the control or displaying Help.       The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.CreateEditorParts%2A> method creates a collection of any custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls that are associated with a WebPart control. Developers can override this method so that it creates custom controls designed specifically to edit their WebPart control. The method is called when a user clicks the edit verb on a WebPart control."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates how to create a WebPart control and reference it in a Web page.  \n  \n The first part of the example contains the code for a custom WebPart control named `TextDisplayWebPart`. This control demonstrates how to create a simple custom WebPart control that gives you access to the features of the Web Parts control set. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This code example assumes that you compile the source code into an assembly, place it in a Bin subfolder of your Web application, and reference the assembly with a `Register` directive in your Web page. For a walkthrough that demonstrates both methods of compiling, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n [!code-vb[WebParts_General_TextDisplayPart#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_102_1.vb)]\n [!code-cs[WebParts_General_TextDisplayPart#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_102_1.cs)]  \n  \n The second part of the example shows how to reference the `TextDisplayWebPart` control in an ASP.NET Web page. Notice that many of the various WebPart properties can be assigned declaratively to the custom control.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_General_TextDisplayPart#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_102_2.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_General_TextDisplayPart#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_102_2.aspx)]"

  summary: "Initializes the class for use by an inherited class instance. This constructor can only be called by an inherited class."
  remarks: "The WebPart constructor initializes default values for several UI-oriented properties, including the various `Allow` properties that determine the control&quot;s capabilities. These properties are then incorporated into an inherited class instance."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates how a control that derives from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class inherits the default property values set in the base WebPart constructor, but then changes the value of one property in the constructor of the derived control.  \n  \n The first part of this example contains the code for a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control named `TextDisplayWebPart`.

Closing a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control is different from deleting it. A closed control can be added back to a page, while a deleted control is permanently removed. For more information on deleting controls, see the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DeleteWebPart%2A> method. Closing a control is also different from hiding it. A control that is hidden is still present on the page, still participates in page life cycle events, and is only hidden from the user&quot;s view, but a closed control is not even rendered on a page.       Both static and dynamic <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls (static controls are declared in a page&quot;s markup, while dynamic controls are added programmatically) can be closed.

  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates how to change the default setting of the AllowClose property for a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, so that it cannot be closed.  \n  \n The first part of this example contains the code for a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control named `TextDisplayWebPart`. Note that in the constructor of the custom control, the `TextDisplayWebPart.AllowClose` property is set to `false`, which has the effect of preventing users from closing the control on a Web page. This means that the close verb on the verbs menu of the control will be disabled for users. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This code example assumes that you compile the source code into an assembly, place it in a Bin subfolder of your Web application, and reference the assembly with a `Register` directive in your Web page. For a walkthrough that demonstrates both methods of compiling, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n [!code-vb[WebParts_General_TextDisplayPart#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_362_1.vb)]\n [!code-cs[WebParts_General_TextDisplayPart#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_362_1.cs)]  \n  \n The second part of the example shows how to reference the `TextDisplayWebPart` control in an ASP.NET Web page. Note that in the `<aspSample:TextDisplayWebPart>` element that references the control, you could also change the value of the property set by the control's constructor. To allow the control to be closed, simply add an `AllowClose=\"true\"` attribute to the element in the declarative markup.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_General_TextDisplayPart#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_362_2.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_General_TextDisplayPart#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_362_2.aspx)]"

  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates the use of the ExportMode property. Note that for the export code example to work, you must also update your Web.config file by adding the attribute `enableExport=\"true\"` to the `<webParts>` element, as indicated in the Remarks section.  \n  \n The first part of this example contains the code for a control named `TextDisplayWebPart`. This control is the same as the custom control that is found in the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class overview, except that it adds a `Personalizable` attribute to the `TextDisplayWebPart.ContentText` property so the property can be exported. Note that the attribute declaration includes a value of `true` for the `isSensitive` parameter, meaning that the property is marked as sensitive data for export purposes. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This code example assumes that you compile the source code into an assembly, place it in a Bin subfolder of your Web application, and reference the assembly with a `Register` directive in your Web page.

  summary: "Gets or sets the height of a zone."
  remarks: "Internet Explorer rendering modes can affect the height of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control and the height of the zone that contains it. Internet Explorer renders Web pages either in compatibility mode (backward compatible with previous browser versions) or in standards mode (determined by the presence of a `DOCTYPE` declaration in the page). For information about these modes, see the DHTML [compatMode](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=57175) property.       When Internet Explorer renders a page in standards mode, under some circumstances it might not resize cells in tables, even when a cell&quot;s HTML markup is `<td height=&quot;100%&quot;>`. As a result, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls and their containing zone are rendered so that the controls do not stretch to the full height of the zone.       When Internet Explorer is in standard mode, controls do not render to stretch to their full height in the following cases:      -   When a zone&quot;s <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.LayoutOrientation%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Orientation> and you explicitly set the height on the zone. To enable controls to fill the full height of the zone, do not specify the height of a horizontally oriented zone.      -   When a zone&quot;s <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.LayoutOrientation%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Orientation> and you do not explicitly set the height of the zone or of the contained controls. To enable controls to fill the full height of the zone, set the height of the zone or of the controls in a vertically oriented zone."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates the rendering issue that affects the height of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone>.  To demonstrate this issue, you must run the page in Internet Explorer.  \n  \n Note that the zone's orientation is set to horizontal, and that the height of the zone and the controls within it is not set explicitly.  The result is that in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone>, the shorter <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control does not stretch to the height of the zone upon rendering.  However, if you remove the `DOCTYPE` declaration from the page and run the page again, the issue does not occur, because now the browser will not render the page in standards mode.  \n  \n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPart_Height#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_579_1.aspx)]\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPart_Height#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_579_1.aspx)]  \n  \n To see how the workaround (described in the Remarks section) works, try adding a `height` attribute to the `<asp:webpartzone>` element, while keeping the `DOCTYPE` declaration in the page.  You can use the following code to add the attribute to the tag:  \n  \n `Height=\"200px\"`  \n  \n Run the page, and now both <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls stretch to fill the explicitly declared height of the zone.  \n  \n You can also experiment with this code example to observe the height-related rendering issue in the other scenario, which occurs when the zone's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.LayoutOrientation%2A> is set to <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Orientation>.  Remove the existing `LayoutOrientation` attribute and its value from the `<asp:webpartzone>` element, which will cause the zone's orientation to revert to the default vertical orientation.  Set the height attribute on the `<asp:webpartzone>` element to 200 pixels, as you did above, and run the page.  The zone's height looks too large, and the controls are not sized proportionately to the zone's height.  Now remove the height attribute and run the page again.  The controls now render relative to the height of the zone."

This is different from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that are closed, because closed controls are not even rendered on a page, while hidden controls are rendered and active in Web Parts applications, though not visible to users. The Web Parts control set hides the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control by setting its cascading style sheet (CSS) style to a value of `display:none`.       Even if the Hidden property for a control is set to `true`, the control is still displayed if the current display mode on the page allows hidden controls to be displayed. For example, edit mode allows hidden controls to be displayed, so that users can edit them. When hidden controls are visible in certain display modes, the title of the control displays a string indicating that the control is in hidden status.       When the Hidden property on a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control is set to `false`, which is the default, the control is displayed on the page.

But there are two cases in which developers do need to call this method. The first case is when control state data is changed during an HTTP `GET` request to a page. By default, changes to control state data during a `GET` request are not persisted (for security purposes). But the SetPersonalizationDirty method provides a way to persist legitimate personalization changes to <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls in this case.       The second case for calling the SetPersonalizationDirty method occurs during an HTTP `POST` request to a page. If a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control has complex personalizable properties (such as a property that contains an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> object), and control state data in those properties is personalized during a `POST` request, developers must call the SetPersonalizationDirty method to ensure that the changes are persisted."

  summary: "Gets the index position of a <xref href=&quot;System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart&quot;></xref> control within its zone."
  remarks: "The ZoneIndex property indicates a Web Parts control&quot;s numerical order (or ordinal position) within its zone, relative to other controls in the zone. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control uses this property to track and manage its collection of Web Parts controls on a Web page.      > [!IMPORTANT] >  You cannot assume that the value of the ZoneIndex property for a control will equal the index value for the same control within the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.WebParts%2A> collection of the control&quot;s zone. Often a control&quot;s relative position in its zone (its ZoneIndex value), and its index within the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.WebParts%2A> collection of its zone, will be different values as controls are added to and removed from zones."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates how to access the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Zone%2A> and ZoneIndex properties for a custom Web Parts control. This example assumes the use of a custom control, `TextDisplayWebPart`, created in the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class overview.  \n  \n The code example includes a custom user control that enables users to change display modes on a Web Parts page. The user control is referenced by means of a `Register` directive near the top of the Web page that hosts the user control. For a detailed description of how to create this user control and work with display modes, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPart_Zone#5](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_1043_1.ascx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPart_Zone#5](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_1043_1.ascx)]  \n  \n The second part of the code example is the Web page. There are two `<asp:webpartzone>` elements on the page, each representing a Web Parts zone. The first zone contains a standard <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Calendar> control, which acts like a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control at run time because it is in a zone. The second zone contains the `TextDisplayWebPart` control. When a user clicks the **Zone Information** button, the `Label1` control displays the values of the ZoneIndex property for the control, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.ID%2A> property of the zone that currently contains the control.  \n  \n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPart_Zone#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_1043_2.aspx)]\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPart_Zone#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_1043_2.aspx)]"
