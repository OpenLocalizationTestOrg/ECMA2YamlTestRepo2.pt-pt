  summary: "A client receiver for multicast traffic from a single source, also known as Source Specific Multicast (SSM)."
  remarks: "The multicast group address and sender source address must be known.       In addition to receiving multicast data from a specific sender, the UdpSingleSourceMulticastClient client can also send unicast data back to the sender.       To receive multicast from multiple sources, or when the sources aren&quot;t known in advance, use the UdpSingleSourceMulticastClient class instead."

  remarks: "The SendBufferSize property gets or sets the size, in bytes, of the send buffer of the underlying <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> used for multicast send operations on this <xref:System.Net.Sockets.UdpSingleSourceMulticastClient> instance.       On Mac OS X, the SendBufferSize property controls how many bytes can be in the network stack&quot;s waiting-to-be-sent buffer before additional calls to the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.UdpSingleSourceMulticastClient.BeginSendToSource%2A> method start failing. Applications on Mac OS X may need to be concerned with this property if they are sending a large number of UDP packets in a short timeframe.       On Windows, calls to the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.UdpSingleSourceMulticastClient.BeginSendToSource%2A> method will take longer to call the callback depending on the value of the SendBufferSize property if the send buffer is full. The SendBufferSize property only controls whether the user&quot;s buffer stays locked in physical memory until the send completes.       The default size of the send buffer on Windows is 8,192."
