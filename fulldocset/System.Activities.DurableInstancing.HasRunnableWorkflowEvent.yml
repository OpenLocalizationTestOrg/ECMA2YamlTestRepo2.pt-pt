  summary: "Represents an event that the SQL Workflow Instance Store raises to notify workflow hosts about the existence of runnable instances in the persistence database."
  remarks: "An instance is *runnable*, if it is not in the suspended state or the completed state and satisfies the following conditions:      -   The instance is unlocked and has a pending timer that has expired.      -   The instance is unlocked and its status is **Executing**.      -   The instance has an invalid lock on it.       An instance store should periodically search for runnable instances that belong to a workflow host that uses the store. It should raise the HasRunnableWorkflowEvent when it finds a runnable instance in the persistence store that matches its workflow host type. If the instance store does not find a runnable instance in the persistence store, it should continue to monitor the persistence store for any runnable instances.       After raising the HasRunnableWorkflowEvent, the instance store should stop monitoring the persistence store for runnable instances until it receives and executes the <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.TryLoadRunnableWorkflowCommand>. The monitoring continues only if the TryLoadRunnableWorkflowCommand execution does not return any runnable instances.       When a workflow host receives the HasRunnableWorkflowEvent, it executes the <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.TryLoadRunnableWorkflowCommand> against the instance store to load the instance into the memory."
