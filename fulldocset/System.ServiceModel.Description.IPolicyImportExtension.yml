  summary: "Defines a method for objects that import custom policy assertions about bindings."
  remarks: "Implement the IPolicyImportExtension interface to search WSDL information exposed by a particular endpoint for custom policy assertions about endpoint capabilities or requirements. Typically, a policy importer searches for a specific assertion and either inserts a binding element, configures a binding element, or modifies the contract to support the requirements of the assertion.  \n  \n Unlike its counterpart, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IPolicyExportExtension>, IPolicyImportExtension does not require implementation by a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement> object; you can load it using the client configuration section shown in the Examples section or programmatically by adding it to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.WsdlImporter?displayProperty=fullName> constructor.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo1](~/add/includes/indigo1-md.md)] passes two objects to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IPolicyImportExtension.ImportPolicy%2A> method, a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.MetadataImporter> and a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.PolicyConversionContext>. Typically the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.PolicyConversionContext> object already contains the policy assertions for each binding scope.  \n  \n An IPolicyImportExtension implementation performs the following steps:  \n  \n1.  Locates the custom policy assertion for which it is responsible by calling either the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.PolicyConversionContext.GetBindingAssertions%2A>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.PolicyConversionContext.GetMessageBindingAssertions%2A>, or <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.PolicyConversionContext.GetOperationBindingAssertions%2A> methods, depending upon the scope.  \n  \n2.  Removes the policy assertion from the assertion collection. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.PolicyAssertionCollection.Remove%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method locates, returns, and removes the assertion in one step.  \n  \n3.  Modify the binding stack or the contract by either adding a required custom <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement> to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.PolicyConversionContext.BindingElements%2A> property or by modifying the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.PolicyConversionContext.Contract%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  \n  \n Step 2 is important. After all policy importers have been called, [!INCLUDE[indigo2](~/add/includes/indigo2-md.md)] checks for the existence of any policy assertions that remain. If one exists, [!INCLUDE[indigo2](~/add/includes/indigo2-md.md)] assumes that the policy import was unsuccessful and does not import the associated binding.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  A malicious metadata supplier can attempt to send malformed XML as part of metadata in an attempt to exploit a policy importer. It is strongly recommended that custom policy importers be robust to all forms of XML that can be passed to it.  \n  \n Custom <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.MetadataImporter> implementations must implement their own <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.PolicyConversionContext> object to extract the policy assertions attached to the custom metadata format.  \n  \n If you want to export and import custom WSDL elements that are not policy assertions, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IWsdlExportExtension?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IWsdlImportExtension?displayProperty=fullName>.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You can use custom policy importers and exporters with the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../Topic/ServiceModel%20Metadata%20Utility%20Tool%20\\(Svcutil.exe\\).md) by using the same configuration elements in a configuration file and the `/svcutilConfig:<configFile>` option."

  summary: "Defines a method that can import custom policy assertions and add implementing binding elements."
  remarks: "Implement the `ImportPolicy` method to obtain policy assertions and perform some modification of the imported contract or binding to support the assertion.
