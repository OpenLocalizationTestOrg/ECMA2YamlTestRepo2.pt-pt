  summary: "Provides the event data for the <see cref=&quot;E:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnected&quot;></see> and <see cref=&quot;E:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnected&quot;></see> events of the <see cref=&quot;T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager&quot;></see> control."
  remarks: "Using the capabilities of the Web Parts control set, it is possible to create a connection between two <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or other server controls, with one control acting as the provider, and the other acting as the consumer of data. To form a connection, the two controls must reside in a zone that inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> class (such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> control), and they must be designed correctly to share data through a common interface. For details about Web Parts connections, see <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection> and [Web Parts Connections Overview](../Topic/Web%20Parts%20Connections%20Overview.md).       The WebPartConnectionsEventArgs class passes event data to methods that use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventHandler> delegate to handle events. There are two such connection-related methods that raise events and use the WebPartConnectionsEventArgs class to provide event data. Both are members of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnWebPartsConnected%2A> method raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnected> event after two server controls have successfully connected, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnWebPartsDisconnected%2A> method raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnected> event after two server controls have been disconnected.       Developers can create custom event handler methods for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnected> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnected> events, and in those methods, they can use the WebPartConnectionsEventArgs class to access details of a connection. For example, a developer can declare the `OnWebPartsConnected` attribute on the `<asp:webpartmanager>` element, and assign to it a custom method name that will handle the event. In the custom handler method, developers can access the details of a connection by using the WebPartConnectionsEventArgs object that is passed to the method as a parameter.       The WebPartConnectionsEventArgs class has two overloads of the constructor. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs.%23ctor%28System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ProviderConnectionPoint%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConsumerConnectionPoint%29?displayProperty=fullName> constructor is the default; it initializes the property values for the class. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs.%23ctor%28System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ProviderConnectionPoint%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConsumerConnectionPoint%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection%29?displayProperty=fullName> constructor calls the default constructor, and then it also initializes the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs.Connection%2A> property.       The WebPartConnectionsEventArgs class has several properties, all of which refer to the essential aspects of a Web Parts connection. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs.Connection%2A> property refers to the associated <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection> object that represents the entire connection. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs.Provider%2A> property references a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or other server control acting as the provider in the connection, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs.Consumer%2A> property references a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or server control acting as the consumer. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs.ProviderConnectionPoint%2A> property references the connection&quot;s <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ProviderConnectionPoint> object, while the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs.ConsumerConnectionPoint%2A> property references the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConsumerConnectionPoint> object."
