  summary: "Provides access to the shared speech recognition service available on the Windows desktop."
  remarks: "Applications use the shared recognizer to access Windows Speech Recognition. Use the SpeechRecognizer object to add to the Windows speech user experience.       This class provides control over various aspects of the speech recognition process:      -   To manage speech recognition grammars, use the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.LoadGrammar%2A>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.LoadGrammarAsync%2A>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.UnloadGrammar%2A>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.UnloadAllGrammars%2A>, and <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.Grammars%2A>.      -   To get information about current speech recognition operations, subscribe to the SpeechRecognizerâ€™s <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.SpeechDetected>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.SpeechHypothesized>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.SpeechRecognitionRejected>, and <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.SpeechRecognized> events.      -   To view or modify the number of alternate results the recognizer returns, use the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.MaxAlternates%2A> property. The recognizer returns recognition results in a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognitionResult> object.      -   To access or monitor the state of the shared recognizer, use the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.AudioLevel%2A>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.AudioPosition%2A>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.AudioState%2A>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.Enabled%2A>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.PauseRecognizerOnRecognition%2A>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.RecognizerAudioPosition%2A>, and <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.State%2A> properties and the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.AudioLevelUpdated>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.AudioSignalProblemOccurred>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.AudioStateChanged>, and <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.StateChanged> events.      -   To synchronize changes to the recognizer, use the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.RequestRecognizerUpdate%2A> method. The shared recognizer uses more than one thread to perform tasks.      -   To emulate input to the shared recognizer, use the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.EmulateRecognize%2A> and <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.EmulateRecognizeAsync%2A> methods.       The configuration of Windows Speech Recognition is managed by the use of the **Speech Properties** dialog in the **Control Panel**. This interface is used to select the default desktop speech recognition engine and language, the audio input device, and the sleep behavior of speech recognition. If the configuration of Windows Speech Recognition is changed while the application is running, (for instance, if speech recognition is disabled or the input language is changed), the change affects all SpeechRecognizer objects.       To create an in-process speech recognizer that is independent of Windows Speech Recognition, use the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine> class.      > [!NOTE] >  Always call <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.Dispose%2A> before you release your last reference to the speech recognizer. Otherwise, the resources it is using will not be freed until the garbage collector calls the recognizer object&quot;s `Finalize` method."

  summary: "Occurs when the state changes in the audio being received by the recognizer."
  remarks: "To get the audio state at the time of the event, use the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.AudioStateChangedEventArgs.AudioState%2A> property of the associated <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.AudioStateChangedEventArgs>. To get the current audio state of the input to the recognizer, use the recognizer&quot;s <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.AudioState%2A> property. For more information about audio state, see the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.AudioState> enumeration.       When you create a delegate for an `AudioStateChanged` event, you identify the method that will handle the event. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The event handler is called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the delegate. For more information about event-handler delegates, see [Events and Delegates](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=162418)."

The <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognitionEventArgs.Result%2A> property of the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionRejectedEventArgs> contains the accepted <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognitionResult> object.       Confidence thresholds for the shared recognizer, managed by <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer>, are associated with a user profile and stored in the Windows registry. Applications should not write changes to the registry for the properties of the shared recognizer.       When the recognizer receives input that matches a grammar, the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> object can raise the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar.SpeechRecognized> event. The <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> object&quot;s <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar.SpeechRecognized> event is raised prior to the speech recognizer&quot;s SpeechRecognized event.       When you create a delegate for a SpeechRecognized event, you identify the method that will handle the event. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The event handler is called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the delegate. For more information about event-handler delegates, see [Events and Delegates](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=162418)."
  example:
  - "The following example is part of a console application that loads a speech recognition grammar and demonstrates speech input to the shared recognizer, the associated recognition results, and the associated events raised by the speech recognizer. If Windows Speech Recognition is not running, then starting this application will also start Windows Speech Recognition.  \n  \n Spoken input such as \"I want to fly from Chicago to Miami\" will trigger a SpeechRecognized event. Speaking the phrase \"Fly me from Houston to Chicago \" will not trigger a SpeechRecognized event.  \n  \n The example uses a handler for the SpeechRecognized event to display successfully recognized phrases and the semantics they contain in the console.  \n  \n```c#  \nusing System;  \nusing System.Speech.Recognition;  \n  \nnamespace SampleRecognition  \n{  \n  class Program  \n  {  \n    static void Main(string[] args)  \n  \n    // Initialize a shared speech recognition engine.  \n    {  \n      using (SpeechRecognizer recognizer = new SpeechRecognizer())  \n      {  \n  \n        // Create SemanticResultValue objects that contain cities and airport codes.  \n        SemanticResultValue chicago = new SemanticResultValue(\"Chicago\", \"ORD\");  \n        SemanticResultValue boston = new SemanticResultValue(\"Boston\", \"BOS\");  \n        SemanticResultValue miami = new SemanticResultValue(\"Miami\", \"MIA\");  \n        SemanticResultValue dallas = new SemanticResultValue(\"Dallas\", \"DFW\");  \n  \n        // Create a Choices object and add the SemanticResultValue objects, using  \n        // implicit conversion from SemanticResultValue to GrammarBuilder  \n        Choices cities = new Choices();  \n        cities.Add(new Choices(new GrammarBuilder[] { chicago, boston, miami, dallas }));  \n  \n        // Build the phrase and add SemanticResultKeys.  \n        GrammarBuilder chooseCities = new GrammarBuilder();  \n        chooseCities.Append(\"I want to fly from\");  \n        chooseCities.Append(new SemanticResultKey(\"origin\", cities));  \n        chooseCities.Append(\"to\");  \n        chooseCities.Append(new SemanticResultKey(\"destination\", cities));  \n  \n        // Build a Grammar object from the GrammarBuilder.  \n        Grammar bookFlight = new Grammar(chooseCities);  \n        bookFlight.Name = \"Book Flight\";  \n  \n        // Add a handler for the LoadGrammarCompleted event.  \n        recognizer.LoadGrammarCompleted +=  \n          new EventHandler<LoadGrammarCompletedEventArgs>(recognizer_LoadGrammarCompleted);  \n  \n        // Add a handler for the SpeechRecognized event.  \n        recognizer.SpeechRecognized +=   \n          new EventHandler<SpeechRecognizedEventArgs>(recognizer_SpeechRecognized);  \n  \n        // Load the grammar object to the recognizer.  \n        recognizer.LoadGrammarAsync(bookFlight);  \n  \n        // Keep the console window open.  \n        Console.ReadLine();  \n      }  \n    }  \n  \n    // Handle the LoadGrammarCompleted event.  \n    static void recognizer_LoadGrammarCompleted(object sender, LoadGrammarCompletedEventArgs e)  \n    {  \n      Console.WriteLine(\"Grammar loaded: \" + e.Grammar.Name);  \n      Console.WriteLine();  \n    }  \n  \n    // Handle the SpeechRecognized event.  \n    static void recognizer_SpeechRecognized(object sender, SpeechRecognizedEventArgs e)  \n    {  \n      Console.WriteLine(\"Speech recognized:  \" + e.Result.Text);  \n      Console.WriteLine();  \n      Console.WriteLine(\"Semantic results:\");  \n      Console.WriteLine(\"  The flight origin is \" + e.Result.Semantics[\"origin\"].Value);  \n      Console.WriteLine(\"  The flight destination is \" + e.Result.Semantics[\"destination\"].Value);  \n    }  \n  }  \n}  \n  \n```"
