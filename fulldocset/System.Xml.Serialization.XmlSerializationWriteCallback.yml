  summary: "Delegate that is used by the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> class for serialization of types from SOAP-encoded, non-root XML data."
  remarks: "During initialization, the .NET Framework XML serialization infrastructure dynamically generates and compiles a temporary class for serialization derived from the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializationWriter> class. During this process, the .NET Framework generates write methods that implement the XmlSerializationWriteCallback class delegate. It does so for certain mappings between .NET Framework types and XML data types that are serialized through SOAP-encoded XML and are not root elements. Then, as necessary, a write method is called during serialization.       You should not directly instantiate XmlSerializationWriteCallback.       SOAP encoding is described in Section 5 of the SOAP 1.1 specification."
