  summary: "Indicates a system suspended power mode. When a system is suspended, the computer switches to a low-power state called standby. When a computer is in standby mode, some devices are turned off and the computer uses less power. The system can restore itself more quickly than returning from hibernation. Because standby does not save the memory state to disk, a power failure while in standby can cause loss of information."
