  summary: "Defines a reference to a method that handles changes to monitored items."
  remarks: "The OnChangedCallback delegate is used by a change monitor to signal to a cache implementation that a change has occurred in an object whose contents are cached. The task of any implementation of the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor> type is to monitor for changes in objects that are cached. For example, if the contents of a file are contained in a cache entry, and if the file is updated, its related cache entry must be changed also. In a typical cache implementation, a derived <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor> instance uses a OnChangedCallback delegate to notify the cache about a change."
