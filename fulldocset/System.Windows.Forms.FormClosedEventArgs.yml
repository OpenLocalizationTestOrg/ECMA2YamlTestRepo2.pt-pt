  summary: "Provides data for the <xref href=&quot;System.Windows.Forms.Form.FormClosed&quot;></xref> event."
  remarks: "The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.FormClosed> event occurs after a form is closed, either by the user, through the user interface (UI), or programmatically, through calls to methods such as <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Close%2A> in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> class, or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.Exit%2A> in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application> class. If a form has any child or owned forms, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.FormClosed> event is also raised for each one.       The FormClosedEventArgs class provides data for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.FormClosed> event. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FormClosedEventArgs.CloseReason%2A> property provides the reason why the form is being closed."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates the use of this type. In the example, an event handler reports on the occurrence of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.FormClosed> event. This report helps you to learn when the event occurs and can assist you in debugging. To report on multiple events or on events that occur frequently, consider replacing <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox.Show%2A> with <xref:System.Console.WriteLine%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or appending the message to a multiline <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox>.  \n  \n To run the example code, paste it into a project that contains an instance of type <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> named `Form1`. Then ensure that the event handler is associated with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.FormClosed> event.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Windows.Forms.EventExamples#395](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.windows.forms.f_12_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.EventExamples#395](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.windows.forms.f_12_1.vb)]"
