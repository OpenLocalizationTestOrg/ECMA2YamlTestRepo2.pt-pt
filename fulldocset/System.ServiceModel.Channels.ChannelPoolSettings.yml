  summary: "Specifies quotas for channels that belong to a pool of channels used by a service endpoint."
  remarks: "Quotas are used as a policy mechanism to prevent the consumption of excessive resources. They prevent Denial of Service (DOS) attacks that are either malicious or unintentional. Use this class when setting channel quotas on a custom channel.       ChannelPoolSettings specifies three quotas:      -   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.ChannelPoolSettings.IdleTimeout%2A> to specify the maximum interval of time for which the channels in the pool can be idle before being closed.      -   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.ChannelPoolSettings.LeaseTimeout%2A> to specify the interval of time after which a channel, when returned to the pool, is closed.      -   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.ChannelPoolSettings.MaxOutboundChannelsPerEndpoint%2A> to specify the maximum number of channels that can be stored in the pool for each remote endpoint."

These default quota values are based on a conservatively modest allocation of resources that are suitable for development environments and small installation scenarios. Service administrators should review channel quotas and tune individual quota values if an installation is running out of resources or if connections are being limited despite the availability of additional resources."
