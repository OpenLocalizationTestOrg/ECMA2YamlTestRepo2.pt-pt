  remarks: "> [!NOTE] >  [!INCLUDE[DeprecatedContent](~/add/includes/deprecatedcontent-md.md)]       A workflow instance can pass through several states during the course of its execution. For example, a workflow instance may become idle, or it may be suspended. Every time the workflow instance changes state, it emits a workflow status event to the runtime tracking infrastructure. TrackingWorkflowEvent enumerates the possible types of workflow status event."
