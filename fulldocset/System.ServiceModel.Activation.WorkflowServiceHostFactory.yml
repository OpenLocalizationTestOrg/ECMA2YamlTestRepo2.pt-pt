  summary: "Factory that provides instances of <see cref=&quot;T:System.ServiceModel.WorkflowServiceHost&quot;></see> in managed hosting environments where the host instance is created dynamically in response to incoming messages."
  remarks: "The managed hosting environments that support dynamic activation are Internet Information Services (IIS) and Windows Process Activation Service (WAS).       If you have implemented a custom derivative of <xref:System.ServiceModel.WorkflowServiceHost>, consider also implementing a factory that derives from the WorkflowServiceHostFactory class.       If you have implemented a custom derivative of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHostBase> instead, then consider also implementing a factory that derives your factory from <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activation.ServiceHostFactoryBase> directly."

For example, the rules definition file CalculatorServiceWorkflow.rules must be in the same directory as CalculatorServiceWorkflow.xoml."
