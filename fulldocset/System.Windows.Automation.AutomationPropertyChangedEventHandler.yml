  summary: "Represents the method implemented by the UI Automation client application to handle the event raised by a UI Automation provider when a property has changed."
  remarks: "The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement> represented by `sender` might not have any cached properties or patterns, depending on whether the application subscribed to this event while a <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest> was active.       Depending on the provider implementation, a property-changed event does not necessarily signify that the property value is different; it might just mean that the property was set, even to the same value. If your application needs to respond only to actual changes, it is your responsibility to track the state of the property."
  example:
  - "In the following example, changes in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.AutomationElementInformation.IsEnabled%2A> property of subscribed elements are handled.  \n  \n [!code-cs[UIAClient_snip#172](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/CustomElementClient/PropertySnips.cs#172)]\n [!code-vb[UIAClient_snip#172](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/UIAClient_snip/PropertySnips.vb#172)]"
