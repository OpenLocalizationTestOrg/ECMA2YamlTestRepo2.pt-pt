  summary: "Represents the method that handles a cancelable event."
  remarks: 'When you create a CancelEventHandler delegate, you identify the method that will handle the event. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The event-handler method is called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the delegate. For more information about event-handler delegates, see [NIB: Events and Delegates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d98fd58b-fa4f-4598-8378-addf4355a115).'

  - For an example of how to use the CancelEventHandler delegate, please see the sample code in the <xref:System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs> class.
