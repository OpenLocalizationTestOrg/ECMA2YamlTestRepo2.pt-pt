  summary: "Provides event-related utility methods that register routed events for class owners and add class handlers."
  remarks: "This class is most commonly used to register a new routed event, with <xref:System.Windows.EventManager.RegisterRoutedEvent%2A>.       The second most common [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_api](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-api-md.md)] usage is <xref:System.Windows.EventManager.RegisterClassHandler%2A>. You use this method to enable class handling of a routed event on the class, or an attached event. For details, see [Marking Routed Events as Handled, and Class Handling](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)."
  example:
  - "The following example show how to use this class to register a new routed event as a class member, along with the routed event \"wrapper\" technique of overriding the add and remove implementations for a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] event.  \n  \n [!code-cs[DPCustom#EventManagerClass](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/DPCustom/default.xaml.cs#eventmanagerclass)]\n [!code-vb[DPCustom#EventManagerClass](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/dpcustom/default.xaml.vb#eventmanagerclass)]"

  summary: "Registers a class handler for a particular routed event."
  remarks: "Class handling is a feature that is available for routed events, including attached events that are implemented with routed event backing. A class handler is like a static handler that exists for all instances of the class. Because the handler is static, you cannot change instance properties directly with a class handler, but you can access instances through the `sender` parameter and/or the event data.       Class handlers are invoked before instance handlers. You can implement a class handler that has the behavior of marking the event as handled. Therefore, instance handlers for a class-handled event are not invoked unless the instance handlers register specifically for handled events.       Many of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] base element events provide class handling virtual methods. By overriding these methods in classes that inherit the base classes, you can implement class handling without calling RegisterClassHandler in static constructors. These class handling methods typically exist for input events and have names that start with &quot;On&quot; and end with the name of the event being class handled.       For more information about class handling, see [Marking Routed Events as Handled, and Class Handling](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       Using this signature, class handlers will be registered to invoke only in response to unhandled events. You can also register class handlers to invoke even if the event arguments are marked handled, by using the <xref:System.Windows.EventManager.RegisterClassHandler%28System.Type%2CSystem.Windows.RoutedEvent%2CSystem.Delegate%2CSystem.Boolean%29> signature, with `handledEventsToo` set to `true`."
