  summary: "Specifies the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) action to be taken in rendering a given <xref uid=&quot;langword_csharp_TextFragment&quot; name=&quot;TextFragment&quot; href=&quot;&quot;></xref>."
  remarks: "TtsEngineAction represents requests for servicing a <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.TextFragment>. The actions correspond closely to elements in the SSML specification and are implemented on the text returned by the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.TextFragment.TextToSpeak%2A> property on a <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.TextFragment>.       The TtsEngineAction value associated with a <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.TextFragment> is returned by the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.TextFragment.State%2A> property.       Processing of the TtsEngineAction value returned by the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.TextFragment.State%2A> property is handled by a speech synthesizes implementation of the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.TtsEngineSsml.Speak%2A> method on a class derived from <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.TtsEngineSsml>."
  example:
  - "The example below is part of a custom speech synthesis implementation inheriting from <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.TtsEngineSsml>, and using the use of <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.TextFragment>, <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.FragmentState>, and <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.TtsEventId>  \n  \n The implementation of <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.TtsEngineSsml.Speak%2A>  \n  \n1.  Receives an array of <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.TextFragment> instances and creates a new array of <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.TextFragment> instances to be passed to the `Speak` method on an underlying synthesis engine.  \n  \n2.  If the TtsEngineAction enumeration value by found from the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.FragmentState.Action%2A> property on the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.FragmentState> returned by the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.TextFragment.State%2A> property of each <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.TextFragment> instance is Speak, the implementation  \n  \n    -   Translates Americanism to Britishisms in the text to be spoken.  \n  \n    -   If the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.ITtsEngineSite.EventInterest%2A> property on the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.ITtsEngineSite> interfaces provided to the implementation support the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.TtsEngine.TtsEventId> event type, an event to drive a synthesizer progress meter is created.  \n  \n3.
