  summary: "Represents the method that will handle the &lt;xref:System.Windows.Input.AccessKeyManager.AccessKeyPressed&gt; attached event."
  remarks: "Access keys in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../Token/TLA2%23tla_winclient_md.md)] are handled by a manager class that acts somewhat like a service for access keys, and forwards access key input to the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../Token/TLA2%23tla_winclient_md.md)] input system. Rather than handling access key pressed events specifically by attaching a handler for the <xref:System.Windows.Input.AccessKeyManager.AccessKeyPressed> attached event on a specific object, it is generally a better practice to associate the access key with a particular command through a command binding, and then handle the routed commands through the corresponding routed events. This technique provides a unified event system for user input regardless of what input mode initiated the input. For more information, see [Input Overview](../Topic/Input%20Overview.md)."
