  summary: "Represents the method that will handle the <see cref=&quot;E:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartMoving&quot;></see> event of a <see cref=&quot;T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager&quot;></see> object."
  remarks: "The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartMoving> event is raised when a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or other server control is being moved within its own zone, or to another zone. This can occur both when a user drags a control, and when there is a programmatic move.       The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartMoving> event is raised by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnWebPartMoving%2A> method, and it provides an opportunity to cancel the moving process before it is complete. If the move is completed and the control placed in a new position, this event is followed by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartMoved> event.       The method specified in the WebPartMovingEventHandler delegate will be called when a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartMoving> event is raised.       Page developers can create a custom handler for the event by adding the `OnWebPartMoving` attribute to the `<asp:webpartmanager>` element, and assigning a custom method name to the attribute. A custom handler can also be assigned programmatically. For more information on programmatically assigning an event handler, see [NIB: How to: Connect Event Handler Methods to Events](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/348e9600-22e3-49a2-8864-11c5bb3e98fc)."
