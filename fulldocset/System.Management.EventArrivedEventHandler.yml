  example:
  - "The following asynchronous example sets up a WMI timer to raise an event every second, and removes it when no longer needed. The <xref:System.Management.ManagementEventWatcher> defines several [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/add/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] events which are raised when WMI events are delivered. Delegates are attached to these events for handling the incoming data.  \n  \n [!code-cs[wminet_EventArrivedEventHandler#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.management.even_0_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[wminet_EventArrivedEventHandler#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.management.even_0_1.vb)]"
