  summary: "Delegate used by the &lt;xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer&gt; class for deserialization of SOAP-encoded XML data."
  remarks: "While deserializing XML documents into .NET Framework objects, the .NET Framework XML serialization infrastructure dynamically instantiates fix-up methods that implement the XmlSerializationFixupCallback delegate. The infrastructure does so for SOAP-encoded arrays whose data types map to .NET Framework reference types. Then, as necessary, a fix-up method is called to fill in the objects in the array.       In addition, during initialization, the .NET Framework XML serialization infrastructure dynamically generates and compiles a temporary class for deserialization derived from the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializationReader> class. During this process, the infrastructure generates XmlSerializationFixupCallback methods for SOAP-encoded, multi-referenced XML data. The methods are then invoked during deserialization.       Do not directly create an instance of the XmlSerializationFixupCallback class.       SOAP encoding is described in Section 5 of the SOAP 1.1 specification."
