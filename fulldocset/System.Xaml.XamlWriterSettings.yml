  summary: "Provides initialization settings for a <xref href=&quot;System.Xaml.XamlWriter&quot;></xref> implementation."
  remarks: "XamlWriterSettings is a class for settings that are used by a <xref:System.Xaml.XamlWriter>; however, XamlWriterSettings does not hold any specific settings. The <xref:System.Xaml.XamlWriter> constructor does not use this settings class as an argument, nor does any other <xref:System.Xaml.XamlWriter> member use it. Instead, the <xref:System.Xaml.XamlXmlWriter> and <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriter> classes include their own settings classes as construction arguments; both classes add actual settings and are based on XamlWriterSettings."
