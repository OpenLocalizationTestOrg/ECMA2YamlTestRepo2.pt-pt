  summary: "Represents the method that handles the <see cref=&quot;E:System.AppDomain.AssemblyLoad&quot;></see> event of an <see cref=&quot;T:System.AppDomain&quot;></see>."
  remarks: "An AssemblyLoadEventHandler is used to specify the methods that are invoked in response to an <xref:System.AppDomain.AssemblyLoad> event. To associate an instance of AssemblyLoadEventHandler with an event, add the instance to the event. The methods referenced by the AssemblyLoadEventHandler are invoked whenever an assembly is loaded, until the AssemblyLoadEventHandler is removed from the event."
