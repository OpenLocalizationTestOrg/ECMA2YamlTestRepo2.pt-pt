  summary: "Provides a callback mechanism that can create an instance of a service on demand."
  remarks: "ServiceCreatorCallback provides a mechanism to publish services that you can request to have created when needed, rather than the service being created immediately when the designer loads. You can use a callback function if the service is not essential and may not be used. A service published by using a ServiceCreatorCallback does not use as many additional resources if it is not requested and created. To use a callback function to publish your service, pass a ServiceCreatorCallback to the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.IServiceContainer.AddService%2A> method of an <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.IServiceContainer>."
  example:
  - "The following code example shows how to publish a service using a callback function.  \n  \n [!code-cs[Classic ServiceCreatorCallback Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.componentmodel._5_1.cs)]\n [!code-cpp[Classic ServiceCreatorCallback Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.componentmodel._5_1.cpp)]\n [!code-vb[Classic ServiceCreatorCallback Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.componentmodel._5_1.vb)]"
