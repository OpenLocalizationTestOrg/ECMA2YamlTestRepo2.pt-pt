  summary: "Provides data for the <see cref=&quot;E:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.PeekCompleted&quot;></see> event. When your asynchronous peek operation calls an event handler, an instance of this class is passed to the handler."
  remarks: "When you use event notification to peek (read without removing) messages asynchronously from the queue, you must create a method that handles your message processing. Your code must call <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.BeginPeek%2A> to begin the asynchronous processing. When a message is peeked, your application is notified through the <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.PeekCompleted> event. An instance of PeekCompletedEventArgs is passed into the event delegate that calls your event handler. The data associated with the <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.PeekCompleted> event is contained in the delegate&quot;s <xref:System.Messaging.ReceiveCompletedEventArgs.AsyncResult%2A> parameter.       There are two ways to provide notification of event completion: event notification and callbacks. PeekCompletedEventArgs is used only with event notification. For information comparing callbacks and event notification, see &quot;Events vs. Callbacks&quot; on MSDN.       PeekCompletedEventArgs provides access to the message that initiated the end of the asynchronous peek operation, through the <xref:System.Messaging.PeekCompletedEventArgs.Message%2A> member. This is an alternate access to the message, and behaves much the same as a call to <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.EndPeek%2A?displayProperty=fullName>."
  example:
  - "The following code example creates an event handler for the <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.PeekCompleted> event and associates it with the event delegate by using the <xref:System.Messaging.PeekCompletedEventHandler>. The event handler, `MyPeekCompleted`, peeks a message and writes its label to the screen.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[MessageQueue.BeginPeek_noparms#1](~/add/codesnippet/CPP/t-system.messaging.peekc_0_1.cpp)]\n [!code-cs[MessageQueue.BeginPeek_noparms#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.messaging.peekc_0_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[MessageQueue.BeginPeek_noparms#1](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.messaging.peekc_0_1.vb)]"

  summary: "Gets or sets the result of the asynchronous operation requested."
  remarks: "AsyncResult identifies ongoing or completed asynchronous operations. The property contains data that helps determine which of several potential asynchronous operations to complete, and when passed to the event handler, enables <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.EndPeek%2A> to access the message associated with the completed operation.       When you call <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.BeginPeek%2A>, a <xref:System.IAsyncResult> is returned immediately, even though a message, if one exists, has not yet been retrieved because the operation is not completed. The AsyncResult indicates the state of the asynchronous operation. <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.BeginPeek%2A> creates the object, which is modified throughout the operation until <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.EndPeek%2A> completes it."
