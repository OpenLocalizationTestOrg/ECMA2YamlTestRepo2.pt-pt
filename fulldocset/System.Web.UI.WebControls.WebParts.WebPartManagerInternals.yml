  type: Class
  summary: "Isolates into a separate class methods that are used by the <see cref=&quot;T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager&quot;></see> control and can be overridden by developers who extend the control, but are rarely needed by page developers."
  remarks: "The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class is the largest class in the Web Parts control set. It is also among the most important Web Parts classes because it is used on every Web page that contains Web Parts controls, and it coordinates and manages all Web Parts controls on a page.       Because the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class is used so frequently, and because it contains so many exposed methods, some methods needed mostly by control developers who are extending the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control are contained in the WebPartManagerInternals class. This isolation of less-used methods into the WebPartManagerInternals class simplifies the API of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class, and the isolated methods do not appear on the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> object in IntelliSense.       Developers who use the WebPartManagerInternals class are likely to have scenarios where they need to inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control and customize it extensively. For example, if you are building a Web portal application or a packaged set of Web Parts controls with custom display modes, custom zones, custom verbs, custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, and other extensions of the base Web Parts user interface (UI), in many cases (not all) you will need to override and extend some of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> members. And although the WebPartManagerInternals class is sealed so you cannot inherit from it, your custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class will likely need to call a number of the WebPartManagerInternals methods in order to manage Web Parts controls on a page.      > [!NOTE] >  Like the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class, the WebPartManagerInternals class provides a server control that has no UI and is never visible on a page. Unlike <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager>, the WebPartManagerInternals class is never declared in the markup of a page; it is strictly a worker object that performs background tasks. The typical way of using it is demonstrated by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class, which references it by means of the protected <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Internals%2A> property, and uses the referenced object to call the WebPartManagerInternals methods.       The WebPartManagerInternals class contains only methods; there are no properties or events. All the methods in the class involve managing <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, or connections between controls.       To handle <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, WebPartManagerInternals includes methods for adding them (<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals.AddWebPart%2A>), removing them <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals.RemoveWebPart%2A>), handling events <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals.CallOnDeleting%2A>), getting or setting details about their relationship to their zone (for example, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals.GetZoneID%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals.SetZoneIndex%2A>), or setting basic <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control properties (for example, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals.SetIsClosed%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals.SetHasSharedData%2A>).       To handle connections, WebPartManagerInternals includes methods for deleting them (<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals.DeleteConnection%2A>), setting which transformer object to use (<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals.SetTransformer%2A>), setting whether a connection is shared and whether it is static (<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals.SetIsShared%28System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection%2CSystem.Boolean%29> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals.SetIsStatic%28System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection%2CSystem.Boolean%29>), and setting a connection error message to use (<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals.SetConnectErrorMessage%2A>)."
