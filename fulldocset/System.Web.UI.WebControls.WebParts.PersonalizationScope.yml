  summary: "Indicates the personalization scope for a <xref href=&quot;System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager&quot;></xref> object or the personalization scope that applies to a property on a Web Parts control."
  remarks: "Personalization scope is a key concept in Web Parts personalization and is tightly integrated with other settings, including the scope that the page, through the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control, is running in; the scope associated with each property on a control; and the way in which the control was added to the page. For more information on personalization scope, see [Web Parts Personalization Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       Personalization scope refers to how personalization data is applicable to different sets of users. Some personalization data is applicable to only a specific user and control on a page. Other personalization data is applicable to all users who view a site. Personalization scope is used in various areas of personalization to indicate which set of data should be retrieved and displayed.       When a page is running in Shared personalization scope, this indicates that only the personalization data for a specific control, applicable to all users viewing the control, should be loaded. Depending on the currently executing user&quot;s rights, this broadly applicable data can also be modified and saved back to the data store. When a page is running in User personalization scope, this indicates that a control&quot;s personalization data should be saved and loaded based on the currently executing user. Usually, this means user-specific data can be loaded and saved on a control, while broadly applicable data (or shared data) can only be viewed on the control.       A <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control, which manages the high-level life cycle of personalization, executes in one of the two personalization scopes."

  remarks: "When referring to the scope associated with a Web Parts control property, `User` scope indicates that the property can only load and store data applicable to all users when running on a page in `Shared` scope. However, when the property&quot;s control is running on a page in `User` scope, the property&quot;s per-user and all-user data will be loaded and merged. In this case, though, only per-user data will be saved when a page is running in `User` scope."
