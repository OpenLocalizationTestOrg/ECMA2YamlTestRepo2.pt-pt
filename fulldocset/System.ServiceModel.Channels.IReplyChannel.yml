  summary: "Defines the interface that a channel must implement to be on the receiving side of a request-reply communication between messaging endpoints."
  remarks: "The IReplyChannel interface includes synchronous and asynchronous variants of a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IReplyChannel.ReceiveRequest%2A> method return an <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.RequestContext> that can be used to construct replies to received requests.       The contract includes synchronous and asynchronous variants of receive, try-to-receive and wait-for-a-message functionality.       An IReplyChannel is not necessarily bound to a single sender. Other channels and channel interfaces provide correlation between the sender and the reply channel, but the base contract makes no such restriction.       The pull model is used with an IReplyChannel to receive messages. This model consists of calling <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IReplyChannel.ReceiveRequest%2A> (or one of its variants) and then waiting for a message to arrive."

The maximum message size is set by the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.TransportBindingElement.MaxReceivedMessageSize%2A> property. The default value is 65536 bytes."
