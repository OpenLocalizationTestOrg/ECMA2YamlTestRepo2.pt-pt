  summary: "Represents the method that handles the <xref href=&quot;System.Drawing.Design.ToolboxItem.ComponentsCreated&quot;></xref> event."
  remarks: "When you create a ToolboxComponentsCreatedEventHandler delegate, you identify the method that will handle the event. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The event handler is called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the delegate. For more information about event-handler delegates, see [Events](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)."
  example:
  - "The following example code provides a method that attaches an event handler for the <xref:System.Drawing.Design.ToolboxItem.ComponentsCreated> event of a <xref:System.Drawing.Design.ToolboxItem>. It also provides a ToolboxComponentsCreatedEventHandler event handler method that writes the name of the type of the components that were created to the <xref:System.Console> when the event handler is raised by a <xref:System.Drawing.Design.ToolboxItem.ComponentsCreated> event.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[MoreEventHandlerExamples#2](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.drawing.design._7_1.cpp)]\n [!code-cs[MoreEventHandlerExamples#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.drawing.design._7_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[MoreEventHandlerExamples#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.drawing.design._7_1.vb)]"
