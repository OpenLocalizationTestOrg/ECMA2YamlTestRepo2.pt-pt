  summary: "Specifies whether a service class supports single-threaded or multi-threaded modes of operation."
  remarks: "ConcurrencyMode is used in conjunction with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConcurrencyMode%2A> property to specify whether a service class supports single-threaded or multi-threaded modes of operation. A single-threaded operation can be either reentrant or non-reentrant.       The following table shows when [!INCLUDE[indigo1](~/add/includes/indigo1-md.md)] permits an operation to be invoked while another one is in progress, depending upon the ConcurrencyMode.      |ConcurrencyMode Value|Can a new operation be invoked?|   |---------------------------|-------------------------------------|   |Single|Never.|   |Reentrant|Only while invoking another service or a callback.|   |Multiple|Always.|"
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates the different between using Single, Reentrant, and Multiple. This sample does not compile without a real implementation behind it, but does demonstrate the kind of threading guarantees that [!INCLUDE[indigo2](~/add/includes/indigo2-md.md)] makes and what that means for your operation code.  \n  \n [!code-cs[C_BestPractices-Concurrency#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/reentrantandmultiple/reentrantandmultiple.cs#1)]"

  summary: "The service instance is single-threaded and accepts reentrant calls. The reentrant service accepts calls when you call another service; it is therefore your responsibility to leave your object state consistent before callouts and you must confirm that operation-local data is valid after callouts. Note that the service instance is unlocked only by calling another service over a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](~/add/includes/indigo2-md.md)] channel. In this case, the called service can reenter the first service via a callback. If the first service is not reentrant, the sequence of calls results in a deadlock.
