  summary: "The exception that is thrown when a call is made to the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort*> method. This class cannot be inherited."
  remarks: "When a call is made to the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A> method to destroy a thread, the common language runtime throws a ThreadAbortException. ThreadAbortException is a special exception that can be caught, but it will automatically be raised again at the end of the `catch` block. When this exception is raised, the runtime executes all the `finally` blocks before ending the thread. Because the thread can do an unbounded computation in the `finally` blocks or call <xref:System.Threading.Thread.ResetAbort%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to cancel the abort, there is no guarantee that the thread will ever end. If you want to wait until the aborted thread has ended, you can call the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Join%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Join%2A> is a blocking call that does not return until the thread actually stops executing.      > [!NOTE] >  When the common language runtime (CLR) stops background threadsafter all foreground threads in a managed executable have ended, it does not use <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. Therefore, you cannot use ThreadAbortException to detect when background threads are being terminated by the CLR.       ThreadAbortException uses the HRESULT COR_E_THREADABORTED, which has the value 0x80131530.      > [!NOTE] >  The value of the inherited <xref:System.Exception.Data%2A> property is always `null`."
  example:
  - "The following example demonstrates aborting a thread. The thread that receives the `ThreadAbortException` uses the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.ResetAbort%2A> method to cancel the abort request and continue executing.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[ThreadAbEx#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.threading.threa_4_1.cpp)]\n [!code-vb[ThreadAbEx#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.threading.threa_4_1.vb)]\n [!code-cs[ThreadAbEx#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.threading.threa_4_1.cs)]  \n  \n This code produces the following output:  \n  \n```  \nThread - working.  \nMain - aborting my thread.  \nThread - caught ThreadAbortException - resetting.  \nException message: Thread was being aborted.  \nThread - still alive and working.  \nThread - finished working.  \nMain ending.  \n```"

  summary: "Gets an object that contains application-specific information related to the thread abort."
  remarks: "The object returned by this property is specified through the `stateInfo` parameter of the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A> method. The exact content and usage of this object is application defined; it is typically used to convey information that is meaningful to the thread being aborted."
  example:
  - "The following code example shows how to pass information to a thread that is being aborted.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Threading.Thread.Abort2#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.threading.threa_10_1.cs)]\n [!code-cpp[System.Threading.Thread.Abort2#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/p-system.threading.threa_10_1.cpp)]\n [!code-vb[System.Threading.Thread.Abort2#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.threading.threa_10_1.vb)]"
