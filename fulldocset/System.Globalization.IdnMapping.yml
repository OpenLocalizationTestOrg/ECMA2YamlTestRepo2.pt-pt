  summary: "Supports the use of non-ASCII characters for Internet domain names. This class cannot be inherited."
  remarks: "An Internet domain name consists of one or more parts, called domain name labels, separated by label separators. For example, the domain name &quot;www.proseware.com&quot; consists of the labels, &quot;www&quot;, &quot;proseware&quot;, and &quot;com&quot;, separated by periods. Standard domain names consist of designated characters in the US-ASCII (or Basic Latin) character range, from U+0021 to U+007E. To facilitate Internet usage in cultures that do not use the US-ASCII character set, the Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) standard was adopted in 2003 to support the inclusion of Unicode characters outside the US-ASCII character range. However, name servers and domain name resolution continue to rely on characters within the US-ASCII character range.       The IDNA mechanism uses Punycode to map an internationalized domain name that contains Unicode characters outside the US-ASCII character range to the US-ASCII character range supported by the domain name system. The IDNA mechanism is used to convert only domain names, not data transmitted over the Internet.      > [!IMPORTANT] >  In the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](~/add/includes/net-v45-md.md)], the IdnMapping class supports different versions of the IDNA standard, depending on the operating system in use:   >    >  -   When run on [!INCLUDE[win8](~/add/includes/win8-md.md)], it supports the 2008 version of the IDNA standard outlined by [RFC 5891: Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA): Protocol](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=231875).   > -   When run on earlier versions of the Windows operating system, it supports the 2003 version of the standard outlined by [RFC 3490: Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=158110).   >    >  See [Unicode Technical Standard #46: IDNA Compatibility Processing](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=232459) for the differences in the way these standards handle particular sets of characters.       The <xref:System.Globalization.IdnMapping.GetAscii%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method normalizes a domain name, converts the normalized name to a representation that consists of displayable Unicode characters in the US-ASCII code point range (U+0020 to U+007E), and prepends an ASCII-compatible encoding (ACE) prefix (&quot;xn--&quot;) to each label. The <xref:System.Globalization.IdnMapping.GetUnicode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method restores the domain name labels converted by the <xref:System.Globalization.IdnMapping.GetAscii%2A> method.       If the string to be converted includes the label separator characters IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP (U+3002), FULLWIDTH FULL STOP (U+FF0E), and HALFWIDTH IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP (U+FF61), the <xref:System.Globalization.IdnMapping.GetAscii%2A> method converts them to the label separator FULL STOP (period, U+002E). The <xref:System.Globalization.IdnMapping.GetUnicode%2A> method, however, does not restore the original label separator character."

  - "The following example uses the <xref:System.Globalization.IdnMapping.GetAscii%28System.String%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%29> method to convert an array of internationalized domain names to Punycode. The <xref:System.Globalization.IdnMapping.GetUnicode%2A> method then converts the Punycode domain name back to the original domain name, but replaces the original label separators with the standard label separator.  \n  \n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.IdnMapping.Class#1](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.globalization.i_1.vb)]\n [!code-cs[System.Globalization.IdnMapping.Class#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.globalization.i_1.cs)]"

The `unicode` parameter cannot begin with a label separator, but it can include and optionally end with a separator. The label separators are FULL STOP (period, U+002E), IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP (U+3002), FULLWIDTH FULL STOP (U+FF0E), and HALFWIDTH IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP (U+FF61). For example, the domain name &quot;www.adatum.com&quot; consists of the labels, &quot;www&quot;, &quot;adatum&quot;, and &quot;com&quot;, separated by periods.       A label cannot contain any of the following characters:      -   Unicode control characters from U+0001 through U+001F, and U+007F.      -   Unassigned Unicode characters, if the value of the <xref:System.Globalization.IdnMapping.AllowUnassigned%2A> property is `false`.      -   Non-standard characters in the US-ASCII character range, such as the SPACE (U+0020), EXCLAMATION MARK (U+0021), and LOW LINE (U+005F) characters, if the value of the <xref:System.Globalization.IdnMapping.UseStd3AsciiRules%2A> property is `true`.      -   Characters that are prohibited by a specific version of the IDNA standard.

  summary: "Gets or sets a value that indicates whether standard or relaxed naming conventions are used in operations performed by members of the current <see cref=&quot;T:System.Globalization.IdnMapping&quot;></see> object."
  remarks: "Domain names that follow standard naming rules consist of a specific subset of characters in the US-ASCII character range. The characters are the letters A through Z, the digits 0 through 9, the hyphen (-) character (U+002D), and the period (.) character. The case of the characters is not significant. Relaxed naming conventions allow the use of a broader range of ASCII characters, including the space character (U+0020), the exclamation point character (U+0021), and the underbar character (U+005F). If UseStd3AsciiRules is `true`, only standard characters can appear in a label returned by the <xref:System.Globalization.IdnMapping.GetAscii%2A> method.       By default, the value of the UseStd3AsciiRules property is `false`, and an expanded subset of ASCII characters is permitted in a label.      > [!NOTE] >  The <xref:System.Globalization.IdnMapping> class prohibits the use of the nondisplayable characters U+0000 through U+001F, and U+007F in domain name labels regardless of the setting of the UseStd3AsciiRules property. This prohibition reduces the risk of security attacks such as name spoofing."
  example:
  - "The following example generates URLs that contain characters in the ASCII range from U+0000 to U+007F and passes them to the <xref:System.Globalization.IdnMapping.GetAscii%28System.String%29> method of two <xref:System.Globalization.IdnMapping> objects. One object has its UseStd3AsciiRules property set to `true`, and the other object has it set to `false`. The output displays the characters that are invalid when the UseStd3AsciiRules property is `true` but valid when it is `false`.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Globalization.IdnMapping.UseStd3AsciiRules#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/p-system.globalization.i_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.IdnMapping.UseStd3AsciiRules#1](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/p-system.globalization.i_1.vb)]"
