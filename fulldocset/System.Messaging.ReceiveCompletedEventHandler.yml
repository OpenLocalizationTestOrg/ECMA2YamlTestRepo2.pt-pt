  summary: "Represents the method that will handle the <see cref=&quot;E:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.ReceiveCompleted&quot;></see> event of a <see cref=&quot;T:System.Messaging.MessageQueue&quot;></see>."
  remarks: 'When you create a ReceiveCompletedEventHandler delegate, you identify the method that will handle the event. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The event handler is called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the delegate. For more information about event-handler delegates, see [NIB: Events and Delegates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d98fd58b-fa4f-4598-8378-addf4355a115).'
  example:
  - "The following code example illustrates how to create an event delegate (ReceiveCompletedEventHandler) for the event handler (`MyReceiveCompleted`) and associate it with the <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.ReceiveCompleted?displayProperty=fullName> event. The event handler receives a message from a queue, and writes its label to the screen.  \n  \n [!code-cs[MessageQueue.ReceiveCompleted#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.messaging.recei_0_1.cs)]\n [!code-cpp[MessageQueue.ReceiveCompleted#1](~/add/codesnippet/CPP/t-system.messaging.recei_0_1.cpp)]\n [!code-vb[MessageQueue.ReceiveCompleted#1](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.messaging.recei_0_1.vb)]"
