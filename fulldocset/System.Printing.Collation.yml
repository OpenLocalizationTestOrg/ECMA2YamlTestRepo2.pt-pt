  summary: "Specifies whether a printer collates output when it prints multiple copies of a multi-page print job."
  remarks: "A standard printer typically collates output by printing every page of the first copy, then every page of the second copy, and so on. When a standard printer does not collate, it prints every copy of the first page, then every copy of the second page, and so on.       Some printers are specially equipped with collating bins. The printing sequence for these specially equipped printers may differ from those of standard printers; however the outcome is the same: each copy of a multi-paged print job contains all its pages in the proper sequence without manual sorting.       Use the values of this type primarily for the following purposes.      -   As members of the <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities.CollationCapability%2A> collection, which is a property of <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities>, these values indicate the type of output that the printer supports. (Many printers support both types.)      -   As the value of the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket.Collation%2A> property of a <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket>, the value instructs the printer whether to collate.       The **Unknown** value is never used in properties of <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities> objects.       You should never set a <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> property to **Unknown**. If some other <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> producing application has created a *PrintTicket document* that sets the collation feature to an unrecognized collation option, then a <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> object in your application that is constructed with that document will have **Unknown** as the value of the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket.Collation%2A> property.       Although the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> and <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities> classes cannot be inherited, you can extend the [Print Schema](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186397) to recognize print device features that are not accounted for in the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> or <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities> classes. For more information see [NOTINBUILD: How to: Extend the Print Schema and Create New Print System Classes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/a3600218-1ea5-478a-9853-6560464f2885)."
