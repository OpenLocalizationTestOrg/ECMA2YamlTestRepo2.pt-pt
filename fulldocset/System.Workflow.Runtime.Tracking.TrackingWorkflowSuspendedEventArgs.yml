  remarks: "> [!NOTE] >  [!INCLUDE[DeprecatedContent](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)]       A TrackingWorkflowSuspendedEventArgs is generated by the runtime tracking infrastructure when a workflow instance is suspended. If the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingProfile> associated with a workflow instance includes a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.WorkflowTrackPoint> configured for a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingWorkflowEvent>, then the workflow tracking infrastructure puts a TrackingWorkflowSuspendedEventArgs in <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.WorkflowTrackingRecord.EventArgs%2A> in the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.WorkflowTrackingRecord> that it sends to the Tracking service.      > [!NOTE] >  TrackingWorkflowSuspendedEventArgs is used only by the runtime tracking service to pass information in a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.WorkflowTrackingRecord>. The data for a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowRuntime.WorkflowSuspended?displayProperty=fullName> event is passed in a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowSuspendedEventArgs>."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates a method, named `WriteSuspendedEventArgs`, which captures a TrackingWorkflowSuspendedEventArgs. The code writes information from the method's arguments to the console, including the value of the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingWorkflowSuspendedEventArgs.Error%2A> property.  \n  \n This code example is part of the EventArgs Tracking SDK Sample from the Program.cs file.
