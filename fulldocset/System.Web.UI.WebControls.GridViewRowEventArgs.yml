  summary: "Provides data for the <xref href=&quot;System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowCreated&quot;></xref> and <xref href=&quot;System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowDataBound&quot;></xref> events."
  remarks: "Before the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control can be rendered, a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewRow> object must be created for each row in the control. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowCreated> event is raised each time a row in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control is created. This allows you to provide an event-handling method that performs a custom routine, such as adding custom content to a row, whenever this event occurs.       Similarly, each row in the control must be bound to a record in the data source before the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control can be rendered. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowDataBound> event is raised when a data row (represented by a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewRow> object) is bound to data in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. This allows you to provide an event-handling method that performs a custom routine, such as modifying the values of the data bound to the row, whenever this event occurs.       A GridViewRowEventArgs object is passed to the event-handling method, which allows you to access the properties of the row that raised the event. To access a specific cell in the row, use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.TableRow.Cells%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewRow> object contained in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewRowEventArgs.Row%2A> property. You can also determine which row type (header row, data row, and so on) is being created by using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewRow.RowType%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewRow> object.       For more information about handling events, see [NIB: Consuming Events](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/01e4f1bc-e55e-413f-98c7-6588493e5f67).       For a list of initial property values for an instance of GridViewRowEventArgs, see the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewRowEventArgs.%23ctor%2A> constructor."
