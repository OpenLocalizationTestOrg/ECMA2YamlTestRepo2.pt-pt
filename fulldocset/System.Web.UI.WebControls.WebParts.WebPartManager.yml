  summary: "Serves as the central class of the Web Parts control set, managing all the Web Parts controls, functionality, and events that occur on a Web page."
  remarks: "The WebPartManager control acts as the hub or control center of a Web Parts application. There must be one--and only one--WebPartManager control instance on every page that uses Web Parts controls. As with most aspects of Web Parts applications, the WebPartManager control works only with authenticated users. Further, its functionality works almost entirely with server controls that reside within Web Parts zones that inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class. Server controls that reside on a page outside of these zones can have very little Web Parts functionality or interaction with the WebPartManager control.       As the hub for Web Parts functionality on a page, the WebPartManager control carries out the kinds of tasks described in the following table.      |Task category|What the control does|   |-------------------|---------------------------|   |Tracking Web Parts controls|Keeps track of the many different kinds of controls on a page that provide Web Parts features, including <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, connections, zones, and others.|   |Adding and removing Web Parts controls|Provides the methods for adding, deleting, and closing <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls on a page.|   |Administering connections|Creates connections between controls, and monitors the connections as well as the processes of adding and removing them.|   |Personalizing controls and pages|Enables users to move controls to different locations on a page, and launches the views in which users can edit the appearance, properties, and behavior of controls. Maintains user-specific personalization settings on each page.|   |Toggling between different page views|Switches a page among different specialized views of the page, so that users can carry out certain tasks such as changing page layout or editing controls.|   |Raising Web Parts life-cycle events|Defines, raises, and enables developers to handle life-cycle events of Web Parts controls, such as when controls are being added, moved, connected, or deleted.|   |Enabling import and export of controls|Exports XML streams that contain the state of the properties of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, and allows users to import the files for convenience in personalizing complex controls in other pages or sites.|       The WebPartManager class has a large set of properties. Consistent with the WebPartManager role of tracking other controls, it has a number of properties that reference collections of either Web Parts controls, or other special Web Parts objects. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AvailableTransformers%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Connections%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Controls%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayModes%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DynamicConnections%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SupportedDisplayModes%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebParts%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Zones%2A> properties are all collections used by the WebPartManager control for its tracking and other management tasks.       Another group of properties contains customizable warnings that apply in certain scenarios that occur in a Web Parts application. These include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CloseProviderWarning%2A>, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DeleteWarning%2A>, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ExportSensitiveDataWarning%2A> properties.       The WebPartManager class overrides some of its base inherited properties, which are used by many Web server controls. These include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.EnableTheming%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SkinID%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Visible%2A> properties.       Finally, there is a group of properties useful for accessing the current state of the application. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayMode%2A> property indicates the current display mode that a page is in. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.EnableClientScript%2A> property indicates whether a control is allowed to render client-side script, which is relevant in situations where users might have browsers with different capabilities or have scripting turned off. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Internals%2A> property is useful for referencing a utility class that contains the calls to a number of important Web Parts methods that are used for extensibility cases. By hiding the calls to these methods in a separate class (the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals> class), the WebPartManager class&quot;s own API is simplified. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Personalization%2A> property provides access to the personalization objects that store users&quot; personalization settings and persist that data to permanent storage. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPart%2A> property indicates which <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control on a page is currently selected by the user or the application. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.System%23Web%23UI%23WebControls%23WebParts%23IPersonalizable%23IsDirty%2A> property indicates whether custom personalization data on a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control has changed.       The WebPartManager control contains five built-in display modes, or views of a Web page. Developers can extend this feature, creating custom display modes by extending types such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class or the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> class. Users can switch a page into the various display modes, provided that the proper kind of controls that correspond to a given display mode are present on a page.      > [!NOTE] >  It is possible to extend this feature so that users can switch into a custom display mode without having a corresponding zone on the page. However, the default behavior is that display modes correspond to zones.       The standard display modes are represented by public fields in the WebPartManager class. The following table summarizes the fields and the display modes they refer to. The current display mode of a page, as noted above, is always referenced in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayMode%2A> property, and the set of display modes that is possible on a particular page, given the kind of zones that are present on the page, is contained in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SupportedDisplayModes%2A> property.      |Field|Display mode details|   |-----------|--------------------------|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.BrowseDisplayMode>|The normal user view of a Web page; the default and most common display mode.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DesignDisplayMode>|The view in which users can rearrange or delete controls to change the page layout.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.EditDisplayMode>|The view in which an editing user interface (UI) becomes visible; users can edit the appearance, properties, and behavior of the controls that are visible in the normal browse mode.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CatalogDisplayMode>|The view in which a catalog UI becomes visible; users can add controls to a page from catalogs of available controls.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectDisplayMode>|The view in which a connection UI becomes visible; users can connect, manage, or disconnect connections between controls.|       The WebPartManager control also contains a number of events that are critical in the life cycle of Web Parts pages and controls. These events provide precise programmatic control over the behavior of Web Parts controls. Most methods pertain directly to <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls (or other server or user controls that are placed in <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zones so that they can behave as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls). However, a few events pertain to the state of the page or connections on the page. The following table lists the available events and summarizes their purposes.      > [!NOTE] >  In all cases in the following table, the word &quot;control&quot; refers to a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control or any server control that resides in a zone and is wrapped with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> object at run time.      |Event|Description|   |-----------|-----------------|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart>|Occurs just before a control is added to a page to verify that it is authorized.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectionsActivated>|Occurs after all the connections on a page have been activated.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectionsActivating>|Occurs just before the process of activating all the connections on a page.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayModeChanged>|Occurs after the current display mode of a page has changed.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayModeChanging>|Occurs just before the process of changing a page&quot;s display mode.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPartChanged>|Occurs after the selection of a control has been canceled.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPartChanging>|Occurs just before the process of canceling the selection of a control.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartAdded>|Occurs after a control has been added to a zone.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartAdding>|Occurs just before the process of adding a control to a zone.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartClosed>|Occurs after a control has been closed (removed from a page).|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartClosing>|Occurs just before the process of closing a control.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartDeleted>|Occurs after an instance of a dynamic control (one that was created programmatically or added from a catalog) has been permanently deleted.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartDeleting>|Occurs just before the process of deleting a dynamic control.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartMoved>|Occurs after a control has moved within its zone or to another zone.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartMoving>|Occurs just before the process of moving a control.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnected>|Occurs after two controls selected for participation in a connection have established the connection.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnecting>|Occurs just before the process of connecting two controls.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnected>|Occurs after two connected controls have been disconnected.|   |<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting>|Occurs just before the process of disconnecting two controls.|       The WebPartManager control has numerous methods for managing Web Parts pages. A large set of the methods, not listed here, are methods whose names take the form of On*EventName*. These methods typically raise their associated event, and provide the event with a handler of type <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartEventHandler>. Most of these methods can be overridden by developers who inherit from the WebPartManager class. Also, page developers can provide custom handlers for the events associated with these methods. For example, in the case of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartAdded> event, a page developer could add an `OnWebPartAdded` attribute to the `<asp:webpartmanager>` element in the markup of a Web page, and then assign a custom method name to the attribute to provide custom handling for the event. The attribute corresponds to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnWebPartAdded%2A> method, and this basic pattern of event handling works for most Web Parts events and their associated methods.       In addition, the WebPartManager control has methods particular to the task of managing <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls (and server or user controls used as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls). These methods include <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AddWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CloseWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CopyWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreateWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DeleteWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisconnectWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.BeginWebPartEditing%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.EndWebPartEditing%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ExportWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.GetGenericWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ImportWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.MoveWebPart%2A>.       Another set of methods is specialized for connections. This includes methods such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ActivateConnections%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.BeginWebPartConnecting%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CanConnectWebParts%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectWebParts%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreateAvailableTransformers%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisconnectWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisconnectWebParts%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.EndWebPartConnecting%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.GetConsumerConnectionPoints%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.GetProviderConnectionPoints%2A>.       Finally, some WebPartManager methods focus on personalization functionality. These include <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreatePersonalization%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.LoadControlState%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SaveCustomPersonalizationState%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SetPersonalizationDirty%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.System%23Web%23UI%23WebControls%23WebParts%23IPersonalizable%23Load%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.System%23Web%23UI%23WebControls%23WebParts%23IPersonalizable%23Save%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SaveControlState%2A>.

  - "The following code example demonstrates both declarative and programmatic use of the WebPartManager control.  \n  \n The code example has four parts:  \n  \n-   A user control that enables you to change display modes on a Web Parts page.  \n  \n-   A Web page that contains two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that can be connected, and an `<asp:webpartmanager>` element.  \n  \n-   A source code file that contains two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, and a custom interface.  \n  \n-   An explanation of how the example works in a browser.  \n  \n The user control has a drop-down list control that shows the possible display modes on a page, given the Web Parts controls that are present on the page. In the Web page for this code example, this user control is declared just below the WebPartManager element in the page's markup, and there is a `Register` directive near the top of the Web page to register the control. For details about display modes and a description of the source code in this control, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection#6](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_345_1.ascx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection#6](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_345_1.ascx)]  \n  \n The declarative markup for the Web page contains `Register` directives for both the user control and the custom controls. There is an `<asp:webpartmanager>` element, an `<asp:webpartzone>` element to contain the custom controls, and an `<asp:connectionszone>` element. The page also contains some inline code that handles connection-related events for the WebPartManager control; you can see the effect of this code as you connect and disconnect controls.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_345_2.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_345_2.aspx)]  \n  \n The third part of the example is the source code for the controls. Note that there is an interface named `IZipCode`, and this interface is implemented in the `ZipCodeWebPart` class. This class has a special callback method named `ProvideIZipCode` that serves as a provider. The other type, named `WeatherWebPart`, is also implemented with a special method named `GetIZipCode`, which enables the control to act as a consumer of the other control.  \n  \n For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This code example assumes that you have compiled the source into an assembly, and the `Register` directive in the Web page references the assembly name. For a walkthrough that demonstrates how to compile, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_345_3.cs)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_345_3.vb)]  \n  \n After you have loaded the Web page in a browser, click the **Display Mode** drop-down list control and select **Connect** to switch the page to connect mode. Connect mode uses the `<asp:connectionszone>` element to enable you to create connections between controls. In connect mode, click the downward arrow in the title bar of the **ZIP Code** control to activate its verbs menu, and then click **Connect**. After the connection UI appears, click the **Create a connection to a Consumer** link. A cell appears that has a drop-down list control. Select **Weather Control** in the drop-down list, and then click **Connect** to complete the connection of the two controls. Click **Close**, and then use the **Display Mode** drop-down list to return the page to normal browse mode. You can enter a ZIP Code, and the consumer control will be updated with the value you enter. Because the `ZipCode` property was marked with the `Personalizable` attribute in the source code, this property value will persist across browser sessions, thus saving the value entered by a user. A more sophisticated consumer control could take the ZIP code information, look up weather information based on the code, and display it to a user."

  remarks: "The AddWebPart method is used both to add new dynamic <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls to a page, and to reopen static or dynamic controls that have previously been closed on a page. When the method is called to add a new control, it actually creates a copy of the control referenced in the `webPart` parameter.

When the method is called to reopen a previously closed control, it returns a direct reference to the control referenced by the `webPart` parameter.      > [!IMPORTANT] >  You should always use the AddWebPart method, rather than the <xref:System.Web.UI.ControlCollection.Add%2A> method of the collection of controls referenced by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Controls%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property, to add <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls programmatically to the page, because using the <xref:System.Web.UI.ControlCollection.Add%2A> method throws an exception. To add a control that is not a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control (in other words, a server control that will be wrapped with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> control at run time), you should first call the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreateWebPart%2A> method to create the control, and then call the AddWebPart method to add the control. For a demonstration of this approach, see the Example section."

  remarks: "The AuthorizeWebPart event occurs whenever a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control is being added to a page. There are a number of common scenarios where a control can be added to a page. For a full description of these, see the Remarks section for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A> method. When a control is added, it must be checked to see whether its <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property has been set and, if so, whether the control is authorized to be added to the page.       Developers can create event handlers for the AuthorizeWebPart event, to provide filtering for controls. If a control&quot;s <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property value does not meet the criteria in the event handler code, the control is not added to the page."
  example:

This assumes the default approach is to allow users to view controls with a page in user personalization scope. Notice, however, that in the example one of the controls has its <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property value set to `admin`. Developers might place this filter on a specialized control that was designed for only administrative users to see. This control will fail the authorization check during the AuthorizeWebPart event, and will not be displayed.

  remarks: "The BeginWebPartEditing method exists so that the process of editing controls can be done in distinct stages, giving developers more control over the process. The method performs a set of initial checks to ensure that `webPart` is in a state where it can be edited. If `webPart` passes all the checks, it is then set as the currently selected control (see the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPart%2A> property), and the editing process can continue."

  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates how to use this method.  \n  \n The code example has four parts:  \n  \n-   A user control that enables you to change display modes on a Web Parts page.  \n  \n-   A Web page that contains two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that can be connected, an `<asp:webpartmanager>` element, and some event-handling code that creates a connection using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CanConnectWebParts%2A> method.  \n  \n-   A source code file that contains two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, and a custom interface.  \n  \n-   An explanation of how the example works in a browser.  \n  \n The first part of the code example is the user control for changing display modes. You can obtain the source code for the user control from the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class overview. For more information about display modes and how the user control works, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n The declarative markup for the Web page contains `Register` directives for both the user control and the custom controls. There is an `<asp:webpartmanager>` element, an `<asp:webpartzone>` element to contain the custom controls, and an `<asp:connectionszone>` element. Notice that in the `Page_Load` method, the code checks whether the connection can be made and, if so, defines a provider, a consumer, and their respective connection points, and then adds a new connection to the set of static connections referenced by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.StaticConnections%2A> property.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_StaticConnections#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/6c629474-a5b1-438b-b1c7-_1.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_StaticConnections#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/6c629474-a5b1-438b-b1c7-_1.aspx)]  \n  \n The third part of the example is the source code for the controls. It contains an interface and two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, one acting as a provider, and the other as a consumer. Because they have compatible connection points (both of them recognize the `IZipCode` interface), a transformer is not needed to make the connection. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. For a walkthrough that demonstrates how to compile, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_StaticConnections#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/6c629474-a5b1-438b-b1c7-_2.cs)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_StaticConnections#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/6c629474-a5b1-438b-b1c7-_2.vb)]  \n  \n After you have loaded the Web page in a browser, click the **Display Mode** drop-down list control and select **Connect** to switch the page to connect mode. Connect mode uses the `<asp:connectionszone>` element to enable you to create connections between controls. In connect mode, click the downward arrow in the title bar of the **ZIP Code** control to activate its verbs menu, and then click **Connect**. After the connection user interface (UI) appears, notice that a connection has already been created by the code contained in the `Page_Load` method."

Regardless of whether a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or server control is static (declared in the markup of a page) or dynamic (added to the page programmatically or by a user from a Web Parts catalog), it can be closed and reopened on a page.       Typically, users can close a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control by clicking its verbs menu and selecting the close verb. A control can also be closed by directly calling the CloseWebPart method and passing it a reference to `webPart`.       On a page where <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls have been closed, if a developer declares an `<asp:catalogzone>` element, and within it adds an `<asp:pagecatalogpart>` element, it provides a simple user interface (UI) for users to restore closed controls to the page at run time. Users can switch the page into catalog display mode, and the closed controls will appear within the page catalog. Users can select closed controls and add them back to the page at whatever position they desire, and then the selected controls are restored to the page and rendered as normal.       When the CloseWebPart method is called, it raises several events: <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartClosing>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPartChanging> (if there are multiple controls), and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting> (if there are connected controls).

  - "The following code example demonstrates how to use the CloseWebPart method.  \n  \n The code example has four parts:  \n  \n-   A user control that enables you to change page display modes.  \n  \n-   A custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.  \n  \n-   A Web page.  \n  \n-   An explanation of how the example works in a browser.  \n  \n The first part of the code example is the user control for changing display modes. You can obtain the source code for the user control from the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class overview. For more information about display modes and how the user control works, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n The second part of the code example is the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This example uses the dynamic compilation approach; thus there is no `Assembly` attribute in the `Register` directive for this control at the top of the Web page. For a walkthrough that demonstrates how to compile, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_CloseWebPart#3](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/b26a8753-d277-40c2-ba47-_1.vb)]\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_CloseWebPart#3](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/b26a8753-d277-40c2-ba47-_1.cs)]  \n  \n The third part of the code example is the Web page. The page contains a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> zone, with an <`asp:pagecatalogpart>` element declared within it. This is what will contain the closed <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control and enable users to add it back to the page. The `Button1_Click` method directly calls the CloseWebPart method to close the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, although a user can also close the control through the verbs menu.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_CloseWebPart#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/b26a8753-d277-40c2-ba47-_2.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_CloseWebPart#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/b26a8753-d277-40c2-ba47-_2.aspx)]  \n  \n After you load the page in a browser, close the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control by clicking the verbs menu (the arrow symbol) in the header of the control, and clicking **Close**. Now change the page to catalog mode by selecting **Catalog** in the **Display Mode** drop-down list control. The page catalog appears with the closed control. Select the check box next to the closed control, click **Add** to add it to the page, and then click **Close** to return the page to browse mode. The control is restored to the page. Now close it again, this time by clicking the **Close WebPart** button."

  remarks: "The ConnectDisplayMode field references a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartDisplayMode> object that is created and contained by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control.

When users want to manage connections between <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls on a Web page, if a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> zone has been declared on the page, they can switch the page into the ConnectDisplayMode mode. The connect display mode displays a special UI for managing connections, which includes the ability to connect or disconnect controls, and to edit the details of existing connections.       If you want to provide users with the ability to manage connections with the UI provided by the Web Parts control set, you must declare an `<asp:connectionszone>` element in the markup of a page. Unlike the elements for the other types of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> zones, you do not need to add any other tags within this element; you simply declare the element by itself."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates the usage of the ConnectDisplayMode mode.  \n  \n The code example has three parts:  \n  \n-   A source file that contains an interface and custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that can form a connection.  \n  \n-   A Web page that provides a connection UI and demonstrates working with the ConnectDisplayMode mode.  \n  \n-   An explanation of how to run the example.  \n  \n The first part of the code example is a source file that contains an interface and two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that are designed so they can be connected. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This code example uses the dynamic compilation approach. For a walkthrough that demonstrates how to compile, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_ConnectDisplayMode#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/f-system.web.ui.webcontr_1_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_ConnectDisplayMode#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/f-system.web.ui.webcontr_1_1.vb)]  \n  \n The second part of the example is a Web page that hosts the custom controls. Within the server `<script>` tags on the page are several methods that populate a drop-down list with the display modes available on the page. A user can select these from the drop-down list to change the page's display mode. One of the available display modes is connect display mode, because an `<asp:connectionszone>` element is declared in the page's markup. Notice that this element does not contain any other child elements; it exists only to enable the connection management UI for users.  \n  \n The ConnectDisplayMode mode appears in this example in two places. First, in the `Page_Init` method, the connect display mode is added to the drop-down list of display modes, as the code loops through the collection referenced in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SupportedDisplayModes%2A> property. Second, the `Page_PreRender` method checks the current display mode on the page, and if the current mode is ConnectDisplayMode, a message is displayed in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Label> control.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_ConnectDisplayMode#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/f-system.web.ui.webcontr_1_2.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_ConnectDisplayMode#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/f-system.web.ui.webcontr_1_2.aspx)]  \n  \n After you load the page in a browser, click the drop-down list and select **Connect** to switch the page into connect display mode. Notice that a message appears, telling you that the page is in connect display mode. Now click the verbs menu (an arrow symbol) in the title bar of one of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, and then click **Connect** in the verbs menu. After the connection UI is displayed, click the link to create a connection. Use the drop-down list within the connection UI that appears, select the other control that will participate in the connection, and click the **Connect** button. The connection is established. Click the **Close** button, and then use the drop-down list at the top of the page to return the page to browse display mode."

  remarks: "You cannot call the CopyWebPart method directly from your code. This method is called internally by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control as part of the process of adding a new dynamic <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or server control to a page. A dynamic control is added to a page programmatically or through the Web Parts user interface (UI), for example by a user adding a control from a catalog of controls, as opposed to a static control, which is declared directly in the markup of a page.      > [!NOTE] >  The method can be overridden in a derived class if developers want to enable the method to handle additional control copying scenarios. For details, see the Notes to Inheritors section.       When a new dynamic control is added, if it is a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, the CopyWebPart method returns a new instance of the control. If the control being added is some other type of server control (such as a user control, a custom control, or an ASP.NET control), the control will already have been wrapped with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> object by the Web Parts control set. When the CopyWebPart method encounters a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> control, it returns a new instance of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> control with a new instance of the child control wrapped within it.       When the CopyWebPart method creates a new copy of a control to return, it also resets the values of all the properties to their default values. Note that, if you want to preserve the values of the personalizable properties and have them copied to the new control instance, you should call the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartPersonalization.CopyPersonalizationState%2A> method as well. The final step carried out by the CopyWebPart method is to call the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreateDynamicWebPartID%2A> method to obtain a new ID for the control.      > [!NOTE] >  Because the method obtains a new ID for a copied control, you should not rely on referencing a dynamic control that is added to a page by its original ID.

To create a custom display mode, you must inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartDisplayMode> class, and to add your display mode as a supported mode on a page, you must inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class and override the CreateDisplayModes method.       When you add display modes by using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartDisplayModeCollection.Add%2A> method, you should add them in the order that you want them to appear in any user interface (UI) controls (such as a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ListBox> control) that provide to users the possible display modes on a page."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates how to use the CreateDisplayModes method.  \n  \n The code example has five parts:  \n  \n-   A user control that enables you to change display modes on a Web Parts page.  \n  \n-   A Web page that hosts the other controls.  \n  \n-   A user control that resides in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> zone on the Web page, and enables you to enter and display text in a label.  \n  \n-   A source code file that contains two controls. One is a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control, and the other is a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartDisplayMode> object to add to the page's default display modes.  \n  \n-   A source code file that contains two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, and a custom interface.  \n  \n-   An explanation of how the example works in a browser.  \n  \n The first part of the code example is the user control for changing display modes. You can obtain the source code for the user control from the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class overview. For more information about display modes and how the user control works, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n The second part of the example is the Web page. It contains two <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> controls, both user controls, and the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control. Notice the `Register` directives at the top of the page to reference the user controls and namespace for the compiled controls.  \n  \n [!code-cs[Webparts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/m-system.web.ui.webcontr_187_1.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[Webparts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/m-system.web.ui.webcontr_187_1.aspx)]  \n  \n The third part of the example is the user control for entering and displaying text. It uses a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.MultiView> control to create multiple views of the UI. One view appears with the `Button1` button, the other without. Notice that in the overridden `OnPreRender` method, the code checks to see whether the page is currently in the custom display mode and, if so, displays the first view of the user control, which includes the button. If the page is not in the custom display mode, for example if the page is in browse or design mode, the button is hidden.  \n  \n [!code-cs[Webparts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/m-system.web.ui.webcontr_187_2.ascx)]\n [!code-vb[Webparts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/m-system.web.ui.webcontr_187_2.ascx)]  \n  \n The fourth part of the example is the source file for the two custom classes. Notice that the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class overrides the CreateDisplayModes method, and that it first calls the base method to add all the default display modes, and then adds the custom display mode. The custom display mode class, `InLineEditDisplayMode`, simply inherits from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartDisplayMode>, sets the name of the display mode in the constructor, and overrides a number of the base properties to establish the characteristics of the custom display.  \n  \n For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. For a walkthrough that demonstrates how to compile, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n [!code-cs[Webparts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes#3](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/m-system.web.ui.webcontr_187_3.cs)]\n [!code-vb[Webparts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes#3](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/m-system.web.ui.webcontr_187_3.vb)]  \n  \n To run the code example, load the page in a browser. Notice that the page is currently in browse mode, and no button is visible. Using the **Display Mode** drop-down list control, change the page to **Inline Edit Display** mode, and notice that now the `Button1` button is visible in the lower user control. Add some text, and click the button to update the control. Notice that the page display is returned to browse mode, the text you entered is now displayed, and the button is once again hidden because the page is no longer in the custom display mode."

  remarks: "The CreateWebPart method is the main mechanism for enabling server controls that are not <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls to take on the same functionality as a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, and thus to participate fully in Web Parts applications. By using this method, developers vastly expand the number of server controls that they can use in a Web Parts application, because virtually any type of server control--standard ASP.NET controls, user controls, and custom controls--can be used.       The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control also uses this method in two other scenarios to wrap server controls with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> object. When users add server controls to a page by using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ImportCatalogPart> control, if the imported control is not a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, the CreateWebPart method is called. Also, when server controls are declared in persistence format within a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone on a Web page, the CreateWebPart method is called for any controls that are not <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls.       When you add a server control to a zone programmatically, a typical approach is to use the CreateWebPart method to wrap the control with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> object, and then call the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AddWebPart%2A> method to add the control to the collection of all <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls on the page, which is referenced by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebParts%2A> property."

  summary: "Gets or sets a custom warning message displayed to end users when they delete a control."
  remarks: "When a user deletes a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, normally a default warning message is displayed. It warns the user that when this instance of a control is deleted, the deletion is permanent. The page developer might provide users with a way to add a new instance of the control to the page (such as through a catalog of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, or through some programmatic means), but the current instance of a control that is deleted is permanently removed. The dialog box that displays the warning includes a button for the user to cancel the deletion, if desired.       The DeleteWarning property enables developers to set the warning message that is displayed to the user.       If a page developer assigns an empty string (&quot;&quot;) value to this property, no warning message dialog box will be shown when a user deletes a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.      > [!NOTE] >  The DeleteWarning property is not displayed in the case of static <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls and server controls. Static controls are server controls that are declared within a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone in the markup of a Web page. Because such controls are static, they cannot be deleted, so the delete warning message is never displayed in that case. Static controls can be closed by a user, but a closed control is added to the page catalog, from which it can be added back to the page by a user, whereas a deleted control can never be recovered."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates the use of the DeleteWarning property declaratively and programmatically.  \n  \n There are four parts to the code example:  \n  \n-   A user control that enables you to change page display modes.  \n  \n-   A custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.  \n  \n-   A Web page.  \n  \n-   An explanation of how the example works in a browser.  \n  \n The first part of the code example is the user control for changing display modes. You can obtain the source code for the user control from the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class overview. For more information about display modes and how the user control works, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n The second part of the code example is the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This example uses the dynamic compilation approach; thus there is no `Assembly` attribute in the `Register` directive for this control at the top of the Web page. For a walkthrough that demonstrates how to compile, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_DeleteWarning#3](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_226_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_DeleteWarning#3](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_226_1.vb)]  \n  \n The third part of the code example is the Web page. The page contains a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> zone, with the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control declared in the zone, so that a user can add it to the page at run time. Note that only dynamic controls (controls that are added to a page programmatically or from a catalog like this one) can be deleted from a page. Static controls (controls that are declared within a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone in the markup of a page) can be closed, but never deleted. The `<asp:webpartmanager>` element declares a custom value for the DeleteWarning property by using the `DeleteWarning` attribute. The `Button1_Click` method assigns another custom value to the DeleteWarning property.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_DeleteWarning#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_226_2.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_DeleteWarning#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_226_2.aspx)]  \n  \n After you load the page in a browser, you need to add the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control to the page. Using the **Display Mode** drop-down list control, select catalog mode. When the catalog appears, select the check box next to the custom control, click **Add** to add it to the page, and then click **Close** to return the page to browse mode. Now that the control is visible, you can delete it. Using the **Display Mode** control again, switch the page into design mode (you cannot delete controls while the page is in browse mode). Click the verbs menu (the arrow symbol) in the header of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, and select **Delete**. The warning that you set on the `DeleteWarning` attribute appears. Click **Cancel**. Now click the button labeled **Change Delete Warning**, which changes the property value programmatically. From the verbs menu on the control, select **Delete** again, and notice that this time the other warning message appears."

  remarks: "The DisconnectWebPart method is called internally by the Web Parts control set when a control is either closed on a page or deleted from a page. In such a scenario, the method is called to remove the control from any connections where it is involved as a consumer or provider. If the control is removed from any connection, this method also calls the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisconnectWebParts%2A> method to end any connections in which `webPart` was involved.       When the DisconnectWebPart method is called, it raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting> event. Normally this event can be cancelled, but in two cases it cannot be cancelled. One case occurs during requests to the page, when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ActivateConnections%2A> method is called.

The other case occurs when a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or server control that is currently connected is either closed or deleted. In this case, because of the control is being removed from the page, its connection needs to be terminated as well, therefore by design it is not possible to cancel the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting> event to interrupt the process of ending a connection. For more information, see the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting> event."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates how to use the DisconnectWebPart method.

For details about display modes, see [Web Parts Page Display Modes](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class creates the display modes for a Web page. Using the base <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartDisplayMode> class, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control creates several standard display mode objects that can be used on pages that contain Web Parts controls.

To enable `webPart` to be exported, a developer sets its <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ExportMode%2A> property value to either <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartExportMode> (which includes all personalizable and sensitive properties), or to <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartExportMode>, which exports everything except for sensitive properties.      > [!IMPORTANT] >  Allowing users to export data from controls, and to import data into other controls, entails some security risks. Developers should use the approach discussed above to protect sensitive data, and if they want to avoid the risk of exposing data altogether, they should not enable export on `webPart` at all. For details on Web Parts security issues, see [Securing Web Parts Pages](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)."

Some controls in the Web Parts control set, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, have a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.WebPartManager%2A> property that can retrieve a reference to the current <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control.

If you are coding in a context where you know the ID of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control, such as writing code inline within a Web page, it is simplest and most efficient to refer directly to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control by using its ID."

The control and assembly referenced in the description file must already be available on the server where a user attempts to import the description file.

This control provides a file dialog box that allows users to browse and locate the description file to import.       After a user finds a description file and begins the import, the description file is read by the ImportWebPart method. If there are no errors and if the assembly and control are found, the server control is added to the catalog within the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ImportCatalogPart> control, and the various property and state data specified in the description file are applied to the control.

  remarks: "The IsAuthorized method is the initial method called by the Web Parts control set to check authorization for a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. It accepts `webPart` as a parameter, and begins a process that ultimately determines whether the control will be added to a page. Call this method from your code directly when you need to determine whether a given control is authorized.       This method carries out the initial tasks of determining whether the control inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class or is a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> control and, if so, what type of child control it contains. To finish the task of authorization, it calls the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%28System.Type%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.Boolean%29> overload method."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates how to call the IsAuthorized method from your code to determine whether a control is authorized to be added to a page.  \n  \n The code example has three parts:  \n  \n-   A custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control that overrides the IsAuthorized method.  \n  \n-   A Web page that creates a filter for a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.  \n  \n-   An explanation of how to run the code example.  \n  \n This code example uses a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control that overrides the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%28System.Type%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.Boolean%29> overload method to provide custom handling of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property. This control checks for a property value of `admin` and, if the value is present, authorizes the control. If a control has a different value, it is not authorized; controls without the property value are authorized as well, as they are presumed not to be part of the filtering scenario.  \n  \n For this code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This code example uses the dynamic compile method. For a walkthrough that demonstrates how to compile, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_IsAuthorized#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/9c13e351-e761-4514-8860-_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_IsAuthorized#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/9c13e351-e761-4514-8860-_1.vb)]  \n  \n The second part of the code example creates a filter that can potentially exclude a control. The following Web page contains three ASP.NET server controls in an `<asp:webpartzone>` element. Notice that the first and second controls have their <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> properties set to different values, and the third does not assign the property. This authorization value can be checked at run time, and the control can be added to the page if the filter matches criteria set by the developer. Notice also that in the `Page_Load` method, the code calls the IsAuthorized method to determine whether each of the controls is authorized, and if so, it sets each control's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ExportMode%2A> property.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_IsAuthorized#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/9c13e351-e761-4514-8860-_2.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_IsAuthorized#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/9c13e351-e761-4514-8860-_2.aspx)]  \n  \n Note that for the code example to work, you must add a setting in the Web.config file to enable exporting Web Parts description files. Ensure that you have a Web.config file in the same directory as the Web page for this code example. Within the `<system.web>` section, make sure there is a `<webParts>` element with an `enableExport` attribute set to `true`, as in the following markup.  \n  \n `<webParts enableExport=\"true\">`  \n  \n `...`  \n  \n `</webParts>`  \n  \n After you load the page in a browser, note that the first control is displayed, because it matches the criteria in the overridden method. The second control is not added to the page, because it is excluded by the filter. The third control is also added, because it does not have its <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property set. Notice that if you click the verbs menu icon in the title bar of either control, they can both be exported because their respective <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ExportMode%2A> property values were assigned."

  - "The following code example demonstrates how to override the IsAuthorized method to determine whether a control is authorized to be added to a page.  \n  \n The first step is to create a filter that can potentially exclude a control.

Note that the code first checks whether the property has a value, so that any control that does not assign the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property will be added automatically. If a control has a filter, the code returns `true` only if the filter value is equal to `admin`. This demonstrates a simple mechanism you can use for displaying certain controls to certain users, depending on their role. While a full example using roles is beyond the scope of this topic, you could use the same logic as the overridden method in this code example, except that you could check whether the current user is in a role that matches the authorization filter value, and then add the control only for that user. This would enable you to create pages where some users would see all the controls, and other users would see only selected controls. This is how the logic that checks the filter might look if you used roles:  \n  \n [Visual Basic]  \n  \n```  \nIf Roles.IsUserInRole(Page.User.Identity.Name, authorizationFilter) Then  \n  return True  \nElse  \n  return False  \nEnd If  \n```  \n  \n [C#]  \n  \n```  \nif(Roles.IsUserInRole(Page.User.Identity.Name, authorizationFilter))  \n    return true;  \nelse  \n    return false;  \n```  \n  \n For the code example to run, you must compile this source code.

The second control is not added to the page, because its filter value is excluded. The third control is added, because it does not have its <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property set. If you change the property value on the second control to match that of the first control, and then run the page again, the second control is added as well."

  summary: "Moves a <xref href=&quot;System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart&quot;></xref> or server control from one <xref href=&quot;System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase&quot;></xref> zone to another, or to a new position within the same zone."
  remarks: "The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control uses the MoveWebPart method to move `webPart` to a new location in the same zone, or in a different zone. You can call this method directly from code, and it is also invoked when a user moves a control to a new position using various options in the Web Parts user interface (UI).       A number of conditions must be met before `webPart` can be moved, and most of these are indicated by items listed in the Exceptions section of this topic. If `webPart` was not contained in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone to begin with, it cannot be moved into a zone.       After the conditions have been met, the following sequence of actions occurs to move `webPart`:      1.  The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnWebPartMoving%2A> method raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartMoving> event.      2.  `webPart` is removed from its current zone (if necessary), and added to its new zone or new position within its current zone.      3.  The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnWebPartMoved%2A> method raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartMoved> event.      4.  The `zoneIndex` of every <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control in both the origin and destination zones is reset to reflect the moved control."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates how to call the MoveWebPart method directly from code to move a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control from one zone to another.  \n  \n The code example has three parts:  \n  \n-   A user control for changing display modes.  \n  \n-   A Web page to host the controls.  \n  \n-   An explanation of how to run the code example.  \n  \n The first part of the code example is the user control for changing display modes. You can obtain the source code for the user control from the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class overview. For more information about display modes and how the user control works, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n The second part of the example is a Web page that contains two zones, each of which contains two server controls. When a user clicks the **Move WebPart** button on the page, the code in the `Button1_Click` method moves a control from the first zone to a new position in the second zone. Notice that the code first must call the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.GetGenericWebPart%2A> method to retrieve the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> object that wraps the `list1` control. This is required because the first parameter of the MoveWebPart method requires a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, whereas `list1` is an ASP.NET server control.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_MoveWebPart#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/49caf3f6-e63d-4133-bdf2-_1.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_MoveWebPart#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/49caf3f6-e63d-4133-bdf2-_1.aspx)]  \n  \n After the page loads, click the **Move WebPart** button, and note that the control that contains the links moves into the middle position in the second zone. This movement of the control is accomplished programmatically by calling the MoveWebPart method. You can also use the **Display Mode** drop-down list control to switch the page to design mode, and in design mode, you can drag the controls to different zones or different positions within their zones. The MoveWebPart method is also called by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control to handle such user-initiated moves."

  summary: "Raises the <xref href=&quot;System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart&quot;></xref> event and invokes a handler for the event, if one exists."
  remarks: "The OnAuthorizeWebPart method is called by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A> method, when a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control is being checked for authorization to be added to a page. When the OnAuthorizeWebPart method is called, it raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart> event, and if there is a handler method for the event, it invokes the handler.       The process of authorizing <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls is an important Web Parts feature. Every <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or server control that is added to a zone by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control goes through an authorization process to determine whether the control can be added. By default, the Web Parts control set does not provide any filtering criteria to prevent controls from being added to a zone. But the control set does provide the mechanisms necessary for developers to create their own filtering criteria. By using these mechanisms, you can create custom filtering scenarios. For example, you could create a filter so that, if a user is in an administrator role, certain controls would be added to a zone when the page is rendered, and if the user is in a user role, those controls would not be added.       The mechanisms for filtering controls during the authorization process are the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property on <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A> and OnAuthorizeWebPart methods, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart> event on the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control.       To create a filtering scenario, there are essentially two tasks. First, you assign strings to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property of each <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control you want to filter. These string values can be arbitrary, but they should contain the criteria you want to filter on. For example, if you wanted a given control to be added to a zone only if an administrator user is viewing the page, then you might assign a string value of `admin` to the property. Then you could use the ASP.NET roles feature, and add all users of your site to various roles such as administrator, manager, and user. When a page is loading, your filtering code would check what role a user is in, compare it to the authorization filter value on a control being checked, and if (for example) the user is in an administrator role and you had set the control&quot;s <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> value to `admin`, the control could be added.       The second step in creating a filtering scenario is to write code to check the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property values on <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, and determine whether each control is authorized before it is added to its zone. There are two options for where to place this filtering code. The first option is the preferred option for page developers. You can create a method to handle the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart> event directly in the Web page server script code, or in a code separation file. Associate your method with the event by adding the `OnAuthorizeWebPart` attribute to the tag for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control in the page, as shown in the following sample markup code.      ```   <asp:webpartmanager id=&quot;manager1&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;       OnAuthorizeWebPart=&quot;manager1_AuthorizeWebPart&quot; />   ```       All your custom method has to do is check each <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control for the filtering criteria and then, based on the results, assign a Boolean value to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartAuthorizationEventArgs.IsAuthorized%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartAuthorizationEventArgs> object to indicate whether the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control can be added. The code in the Example section demonstrates how to do this.       The second option for where to place your filtering code is to inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class, and override a method to check the filter criteria. The two methods you can override to do this are the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%28System.Type%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.Boolean%29?displayProperty=fullName> method or the OnAuthorizeWebPart method. Although either method would work, in most cases it is preferable to override the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A> method, because it provides you with greater programmatic control over the whole authorization process, whereas the OnAuthorizeWebPart method does only one specific task, which is to raise the event and check for a handler. For a code example of a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class that overrides the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A> method, see the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%28System.Type%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.Boolean%29?displayProperty=fullName> overload of the method."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates how to set a custom event handler for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart> event, so that the handler can provide custom filtering code for the OnAuthorizeWebPart method. This example would be a typical way for a page developer to provide a filtering scenario and authorization of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls to be added to a page.  \n  \n In the Web page, notice that the `<asp:webpartmanager>` element has the `OnAuthorizeWebPart` attribute with the name of the event handler assigned to it. The method checks whether the controls on the page have their respective <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property values set to `admin` and, if so, returns `true`, which means that they will be authorized and added to the page.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Note that controls that do not have any value assigned to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property are added as well, because they are assumed not to be part of a filtering scenario. This would be a common approach in a filtering scenario: some controls would be filtered, and others would not be, because they are presumed to be available for all users.  \n  \n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_AuthorizeWebPart#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/fb74240d-1119-4128-abbc-_1.aspx)]\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_AuthorizeWebPart#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/fb74240d-1119-4128-abbc-_1.aspx)]  \n  \n Because setting up users in roles is beyond the scope of this topic, this code example does not check user roles in the filtering. However, the scenario of filtering controls according to user roles is likely to be one of the most common uses of this filtering feature. If you have roles on your site, and you want to check user roles in this method to filter controls, the method would resemble the following code block (versus the simpler approach in the preceding code example, which does not use roles).  \n  \n [Visual Basic]  \n  \n```  \nProtected Sub WebPartManager1_AuthorizeWebPart(ByVal sender _  \n  As Object, ByVal e As WebPartAuthorizationEventArgs)  \n  \n  If String.IsNullOrEmpty(e.AuthorizationFilter) Then  \n    If Roles.IsUserInRole(Page.User.Identity.Name, _  \n      e.AuthorizationFilter) Then  \n  \n      e.IsAuthorized = True  \n    Else  \n      e.IsAuthorized = False  \n    End If  \n  End If  \n  \nEnd Sub  \n```  \n  \n [C#]  \n  \n```  \nprotected void mgr1_AuthorizeWebPart(object sender,   \n  WebPartAuthorizationEventArgs e)  \n{  \n  if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(e.AuthorizationFilter))  \n  {  \n    if(Roles.IsUserInRole(Page.User.Identity.Name, e.authorizationFilter))  \n      e.IsAuthorized = true;  \n    else  \n      e.IsAuthorized = false;  \n  }  \n}  \n```"

  remarks: "The OnSelectedWebPartChanged method raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPartChanged> event, which is typically a point in time where a developer might want to change the appearance of the user interface (UI). For example, when a new <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control is selected, the Web Parts control set changes the rendering of the newly selected control. After a control&quot;s selection is cleared, the rendering is returned to normal.       After a user selects a particular <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control for editing, the OnSelectedWebPartChanged method is called. When the user finishes editing the control and closes it, with the result that the control&quot;s selection is cleared, the OnSelectedWebPartChanged method is called again."

  summary: "Gets a reference to an object that contains personalization data for a Web page."
  remarks: "The Personalization property provides a way to access the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartPersonalization> object that is associated with a page through the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control. Using this property, you can access the various members of the personalization object. For example, you can use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartPersonalization.ToggleScope%2A> method to switch the page&quot;s personalization scope from shared to user scope, or vice versa. You can also find out the current personalization scope of the page, whether personalization is even enabled on the page, which provider is being used for the personalization data, and more.       Note that the data referenced by the Personalization property is only the page-level personalization data that is tracked by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control. Control-specific personalization data, such as the values of personalizable properties on <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, is not part of the Personalization property.      > [!NOTE] >  For more information on Web Parts personalization, see [Web Parts Personalization Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates how to use the Personalization property programmatically.  \n  \n The following Web page allows a user to enter edit mode to edit certain aspects of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Calendar> control. The **Toggle Scope** button switches the page to user or shared personalization scope. The **Edit Mode** and **Browse Mode** buttons each switch the page into the appropriate display mode. Notice that in the `<script>` tag section of the file, two of the methods that handle events use the Personalization property to access useful members of the underlying object. Specifically, these methods use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartPersonalization.ToggleScope%2A> method and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartPersonalization.Scope%2A> property on the object accessed through the Personalization property.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_Personalization#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_970_1.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_Personalization#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_970_1.aspx)]  \n  \n For the code example to run, you also must enable a user or users to personalize pages in shared scope. Add an entry to the Web.config file, within the `<system.web>` section, that looks like the following markup.  \n  \n```  \n<webParts>  \n  <personalization>  \n    <authorization>  \n      <allow  \n        users=\"[Replace the text and brackets with a user name or   \n           group.]\"  \n        roles=\"admin\"   \n        verbs=\"enterSharedScope\"  />  \n    </authorization>  \n  </personalization>  \n</webParts>   \n```  \n  \n After you load the page in a browser, click the **Toggle Scope** button, and notice that the page now says the scope is shared. Click **Edit Mode** to change the display mode, click the verbs menu on the visible control, and select **Edit** from the menu. Notice that the user interface (UI) for both editing controls appears. Now click **Browse Mode** to return to normal browsing. If the page says it is in shared scope, click **Toggle Scope** again to ensure the page is in user scope. Next, follow the same steps to edit the control again, but notice that now in the editing UI, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.BehaviorEditorPart> control does not appear. That is because this control only works when the page is in shared personalization scope."

There is an `<asp:webpartmanager>` element, an `<asp:webpartzone>` element to contain the custom controls, and an `<asp:connectionszone>` element. Notice that in the `Page_Load` method, the code checks to see whether a connection already exists and, if not, defines a provider, a consumer, and their respective connection points, and then adds a new connection to the set of static connections referenced by the StaticConnections property.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_StaticConnections#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_98_1.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_StaticConnections#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_98_1.aspx)]  \n  \n After you have loaded the Web page in a browser, click the **Display Mode** drop-down list control and select **Connect** to switch the page to connect mode. Connect mode uses the `<asp:connectionszone>` element to enable you to create connections between controls. In connect mode, click the downward arrow in the title bar of the **ZIP Code** control to activate its verbs menu, and then click **Connect**. After the connection user interface (UI) appears, notice that a connection has already been created by the code contained in the `Page_Load` method. If you return to this page in a later browser session, this static connection will already be established and will not need to be recreated each time the page loads."

For example, if a Web page contains an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> zone but not a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> zone, then the edit display mode is one of the supported modes on that page, but the catalog display mode is not supported.      > [!NOTE] >  The SupportedDisplayModes property differs from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayModes%2A> property, which references a collection containing all the display modes that are available to the current <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control, even those that are not supported on a particular page."

  remarks: "The IPersonalizable.IsDirty property provides a way for callers to determine whether personalization state data that is managed by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control has changed.

This is a pass-through method that returns to callers the value of the protected <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsCustomPersonalizationStateDirty%2A> property, which cannot be directly accessed by callers.      > [!NOTE] >  The IPersonalizable.IsDirty property does not indicate whether personalizable property values, or individual properties that affect the appearance of individual <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, have changed. Control-level personalization is tracked for each control individually. The IPersonalizable.IsDirty property indicates only whether personalization data that is at the page level and is managed by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control has changed.       The following list describes some common instances of personalization that would cause the IPersonalizable.IsDirty property to return a value of `true`, indicating that the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control has some changed personalization data:      -   Closing a static <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control (or server or user control) on a page.      -   Restoring a closed static <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control from a page catalog back to a page.      -   Moving any control within its zone or to another zone.      -   Adding a control from a catalog of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or server controls, or adding a control programmatically.      -   Creating a connection between two <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, either programmatically or by using the connection user interface (UI).      -   Deleting a connection between two <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, either programmatically or by using the connection UI.       To access this property value, you must cast the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control instance to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IPersonalizable> interface; you can then read the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IPersonalizable.IsDirty%2A> property value."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates a simple usage of the IPersonalizable.IsDirty property, to indicate some common page personalization instances that cause a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control's personalization data to change.  \n  \n The code example has four parts:  \n  \n-   A user control that allows you to change display modes on a page that contains Web Parts controls.  \n  \n-   A source file that contains the code for two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that can be connected, and an interface.  \n  \n-   A Web page that hosts all the controls.  \n  \n-   An explanation of how the code example works.  \n  \n The first part of the code example is the user control for changing display modes. You can obtain the source code for the user control from the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class overview. For information about display modes and how the user control works, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n The second part of the example is the source file with the custom controls and the interface. Notice that the `IZipCode` interface exposes one method, and that this method as implemented in the custom `ZipCodeWebPart` control serves as a callback method to enable `ZipCodeWebPart` to act as a provider in a connection scenario. The other control, `WeatherWebPart`, acts as the consumer control in a connection; it can consume the particular interface provided by `ZipCodeWebPart`. In a real application, `WeatherWebPart` could consume a personalized ZIP Code value from the provider, and then provide graphical weather information to users.  \n  \n For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This code example uses dynamic compilation; therefore, notice that the `Register` directive for this component at the top of the Web page contains only `TagPrefix` and `Namespace` attributes, without an `Assembly` attribute. For a walkthrough that demonstrates how to compile, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_IsDirty#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/c24ecc1a-95a5-4007-8876-_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_IsDirty#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/c24ecc1a-95a5-4007-8876-_1.vb)]  \n  \n The third part of the code example is the Web page. Notice that it contains two <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> zones, with the first one containing the two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. There is also a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> zone, which contains a standard <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Calendar> control that users can add to the page. The `<asp:connectionszone>` element provides a connection UI for users to create connections between controls. In the `Page_PreRender` method, notice that it checks to see whether the personalization data has changed and, if so, updates the text of `Label1`.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_IsDirty#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/c24ecc1a-95a5-4007-8876-_2.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_IsDirty#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/c24ecc1a-95a5-4007-8876-_2.aspx)]  \n  \n After you load the page in a browser, try to create some of the scenarios listed in the Remarks section of this topic that will change the personalization data. As you make various changes, when a change involves one of the personalization scenarios tracked by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control, the text of the `Label1` control is displayed to indicate that personalization data has changed. For example, you can:  \n  \n-   Create a connection between controls by clicking the **Connect WebPart Controls** button.  \n  \n-   Use the **Display Mode** drop-down list control to switch the page to catalog mode, and add the **My Calendar** control to the second <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> zone.  \n  \n-   Change the page back to browse mode, click on the verbs menu (shown with an arrow symbol in the title bar) for the **My Calendar** control, and select **Close** to close it and add it to the page catalog.  \n  \n-   Return the page to catalog mode, and add the **My Calendar** control back to the page.  \n  \n-   Use the **Display Mode** control to switch the page to design mode, and rearrange the layout of the controls by dragging one or more of them to another zone, or to a different position in the same zone."

However, there is little reason to use a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control outside of a zone, because it then loses its Web Parts functionality and acts as a normal server control.       Any type of control that can be placed in a zone, whether a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, a standard ASP.NET control, a user control, or a custom server control, can be treated as a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control at run time. When a control that is not a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control is placed in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> zone, at run time ASP.NET wraps the control with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> object, so that the control can behave as a true <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. Therefore, by using the WebParts property, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control can track any type of server control, regardless of whether it derives from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates how to use the WebParts property programmatically to access individual <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. Notice that in the declarative markup for the Web page, within the `<asp:webpartzone>` element there are two standard ASP.NET server controls. Although these do not inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class, because they are in a zone they will be wrapped with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> object at run time, and thus will be included in the collection referenced by the WebParts property. You could also add custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, user controls, or custom server controls in this zone, and they would be handled the same way.  \n  \n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_WebParts#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_992_1.aspx)]\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartManager_WebParts#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_992_1.aspx)]  \n  \n Note that for the code example to work, you must add a setting in the Web.config file to enable exporting Web Parts description files. Ensure that you have a Web.config file in the same directory as the Web page for this code example. Within the `<system.web>` section, make sure there is a `<webParts>` element with an `enableExport` attribute set to `true`, as in the following markup.  \n  \n `<webParts enableExport=\"true\">`  \n  \n `...`  \n  \n `</webParts>`  \n  \n After you load the page into a browser, if you click the **WebPart Count** button, the code uses the WebParts property to return the count of controls in the collection. If you click the **Hide Calendar Title** button, the code changes the calendar so that it renders with only a border and not a title."

Normally, when the WebPartsDisconnecting event is raised as a direct result of a user&quot;s action that ends a connection, the event can be cancelled. However, there are several scenarios in which the event cannot be cancelled. The first scenario is, if a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> control is deleted, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls it contains must all be closed, otherwise they would be orphaned. In this case the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control closes the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, not the user, and it must also be able to terminate the connections of any connected controls without any chance of interruption, so that it can complete the process of cleaning up and closing all the controls. Therefore, by design the WebPartsDisconnecting method cannot be cancelled in this scenario. For a related event that can be cancelled, see the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartClosing> event.       The second scenario in which the WebPartsDisconnecting event cannot be cancelled is when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ActivateConnections%2A> method is called (this called during each request to a page, for example), and there is some type of conflict in the existing connections on a page. For example, perhaps a user connects control x to control y, but a shared user connects control x to control z, and yet control x is not allowed to form multiple connections. In this case, the individual user&quot;s settings for the connection take precedence, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control resolves the conflict by calling the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisconnectWebPart%2A> method and ending the connection between x and z for the particular user. Because this disconnection is essential to resolving the conflict, by design the WebPartsDisconnecting event cannot be cancelled in this scenario.       The third scenario in which the WebPartsDisconnecting method cannot be cancelled is when a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or server control that is currently connected is either deleted or closed. Because the control is definitely going to be removed from the page, it is a logical necessity to remove its connection. Therefore, when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control invokes the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisconnectWebPart%2A> method, which in turn raises the WebPartsDisconnecting event, by design there is no possibility of canceling the event."
