  summary: "Specifies whether any changes were made to a merged <see cref=&quot;T:System.Printing.PrintTicket&quot;></see> to ensure a viable <see cref=&quot;T:System.Printing.PrintTicket&quot;></see>."
  remarks: "When the <xref:System.Printing.PrintQueue.MergeAndValidatePrintTicket%2A> method merges two <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> objects, the initial print ticket may request printing functions that the printer does not support. In such cases, the printer driver changes the non-viable settings to ensure that the final print ticket is viable. The <xref:System.Printing.PrintQueue.MergeAndValidatePrintTicket%2A> method uses this enumeration to report whether it had to make changes to ensure a viable print ticket."
