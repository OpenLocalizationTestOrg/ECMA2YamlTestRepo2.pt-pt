  summary: "Initializes the associated &lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationInitializer.CorrelationHandle%2A&gt; with a.NET Context Exchange-based correlation, subject to the &lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.ContextExchangeMechanism&gt; specified."
  remarks: "A context correlation is based on the context exchange mechanism described in the [.NET Context Exchange Protocol Specification](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=163882). To use context correlation a context-based binding such as <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpContextBinding>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpContextBinding>, or <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpContextBinding> must be used."
