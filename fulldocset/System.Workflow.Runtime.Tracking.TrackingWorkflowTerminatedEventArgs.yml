  summary: "Contains data associated with the termination of a workflow instance."
  remarks: "> [!NOTE] >  [!INCLUDE[DeprecatedContent](~/add/includes/deprecatedcontent-md.md)]       A TrackingWorkflowTerminatedEventArgs is generated by the runtime tracking infrastructure when a workflow instance is terminated. If the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingProfile> associated with a workflow instance includes a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.WorkflowTrackPoint> configured for a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingWorkflowEvent><xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingWorkflowEvent>, the workflow tracking infrastructure puts the TrackingWorkflowTerminatedEventArgs in <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.WorkflowTrackingRecord.EventArgs%2A> in the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.WorkflowTrackingRecord> that it sends to the tracking service.       A workflow instance may be terminated in one of three ways: the host may call <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowInstance.Terminate%2A?displayProperty=fullName>; a <xref:System.Workflow.ComponentModel.TerminateActivity> activity may be invoked from inside the workflow instance; or an unhandled exception may occur. If the workflow is terminated by the host or a <xref:System.Workflow.ComponentModel.TerminateActivity> activity, the runtime tracking infrastructure sets <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingWorkflowTerminatedEventArgs.Exception%2A> to a <xref:System.Workflow.ComponentModel.WorkflowTerminatedException> that has its <xref:System.Exception.Message%2A> property set to a description of the reason for the termination. If the workflow is terminated because of an unhandled exception, the runtime tracking infrastructure passes the unhandled exception in <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingWorkflowTerminatedEventArgs.Exception%2A>.      > [!NOTE] >  TrackingWorkflowTerminatedEventArgs is used only by the runtime tracking service to pass information in a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.WorkflowTrackingRecord>. The data for a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowRuntime.WorkflowTerminated?displayProperty=fullName> event is passed in a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowTerminatedEventArgs>."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates a method, named `WriteTerminatedEventArgs`, which captures a TrackingWorkflowTerminatedEventArgs. The code checks whether the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingWorkflowTerminatedEventArgs.Exception%2A> property is `null` (`Nothing` in Visual Basic). If it is not, the code writes the message associated with the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingWorkflowTerminatedEventArgs.Exception%2A> property to the console. If <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingWorkflowTerminatedEventArgs.Exception%2A> is `null` (`Nothing`), the code does not write any exception information to the console.  \n  \n This code example is part of the EventArgs Tracking SDK Sample from the Program.cs file.

  remarks: "When the workflow instance is terminated because of an unhandled exception, Exception contains the unhandled exception.       When the workflow instance is terminated by either a host call to <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowInstance.Terminate%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or by a <xref:System.Workflow.ComponentModel.TerminateActivity> activity,    Exception contains a <xref:System.Workflow.ComponentModel.WorkflowTerminatedException> that has its <xref:System.Exception.Message%2A> property set to a description of the reason for the termination.
