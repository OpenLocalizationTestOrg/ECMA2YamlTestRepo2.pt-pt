  summary: "Configures the location of a custom implementation of the authentication service."
  remarks: "The AuthenticationServiceManager class corresponds to the <xref:System.Web.UI.ScriptManager.AuthenticationService%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.ScriptManager> or <xref:System.Web.UI.ScriptManagerProxy> control.       The authentication Web service is used by AJAX-enabled applications to log on and log off from client script. You can use AuthenticationServiceManager to provide the path of an alternative implementation of the authentication Web service instead of using the built-in Web service that is provided by the AJAX features of ASP.NET.       To use the authentication service in your application, you must enable it in the configuration file. If you use the built-in authentication Web service, you do not have to explicitly declare the authentication service manager on the page.       To create your own authentication service, you must implement a Web service that has two methods: `Login` and `Logout`. In addition, these methods require the same signature of the built-in authentication Web service.       The following example shows the basic class structure that must be implemented in a custom authentication Web service class.       [!code-cs[XpsCreate#XpsCreateAddPkgContent](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/XpsCreate/XpsCreate.cs#xpscreateaddpkgcontent)]       To use a custom authentication Web service, you can add the service declaratively in markup by including an `<AuthenticationService>` element inside the `<asp:ScriptManager>` element on the page, as shown in the following example.      ```   <asp:ScriptManager ID=&quot;SM1&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;>     <AuthenticationService Path=&quot;MyAuthenticationService.asmx&quot; />   </asp:ScriptManager>   ```       You can also programmatically configure <xref:System.Web.UI.AuthenticationServiceManager.Path%2A> to use a custom authentication Web service.       Regardless of whether the declarative section for the authentication service is on the page, if the authentication service is enabled in the configuration file, then AJAX-enabled applications will include an ECMAScript (JavaScript) variable in the rendered page. This allows client script to determine whether the current user is authenticated."

  summary: "Gets or sets the path of the authentication service."
  remarks: "If the Path property is not set, then the return value is <xref:System.String?displayProperty=fullName>. In this case, the AJAX functionality in ASP.NET will then use the built-in authentication Web service that corresponds to the following internal default path: ~/ScriptServices_AuthenticationService.asmx. The same behavior occurs if you set Path to an empty value or `null`.       Path can be specified in the <xref:System.Web.UI.ScriptManager> control or in an associated <xref:System.Web.UI.ScriptManagerProxy> control. When Path is set at the <xref:System.Web.UI.ScriptManagerProxy> level, the following caveats apply:      -   If there are multiple proxies in the control hierarchy, Path does not have to be set on each proxy instance.      -   If Path is explicitly set on a proxy instance, the value must be the same for all other proxies on which this property is explicitly set."
