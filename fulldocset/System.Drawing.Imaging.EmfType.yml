  summary: "Specifies the nature of the records that are placed in an Enhanced Metafile (EMF) file. This enumeration is used by several constructors in the <xref href=&quot;System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile&quot;></xref> class."
  remarks: "GDI+ uses the enhanced Windows metafile image format (EMF). The EMF format contains a comment mechanism for embedding data within the metafile. This comment mechanism is used to embed GDI+ records within an EMF file. EMF files that contain GDI+ data are called EMF+ files. Applications that do not recognize the comment data skip the comment records and render the records they do understand. If the EMF+ file is played back by GDI+, then the GDI+ records are used to render the metafile; otherwise, the GDI records (if present) are used."
