  summary: "Represents a method that handles the <see cref=&quot;E:System.AppDomain.TypeResolve&quot;></see>, <see cref=&quot;E:System.AppDomain.ResourceResolve&quot;></see>, or <see cref=&quot;E:System.AppDomain.AssemblyResolve&quot;></see> event of an <see cref=&quot;T:System.AppDomain&quot;></see>."
  remarks: "If the runtime class loader cannot resolve a reference to an assembly, type, or resource, the corresponding events are raised to give the callback a chance to tell the runtime which assembly the referenced assembly, type, or resource is in. It is the responsibility of the ResolveEventHandler to return the assembly that resolves the type, assembly, or resource, or to return null if the assembly is not recognized. For more information, see [Resolving Assembly Loads](../Topic/Resolving%20Assembly%20Loads.md) and the <xref:System.AppDomain.ResourceResolve?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.AppDomain.AssemblyResolve?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.AppDomain.ReflectionOnlyAssemblyResolve?displayProperty=fullName> events.      > [!IMPORTANT] >  Beginning with the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](~/add/includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], the ResolveEventHandler event is raised for all assemblies, including resource assemblies. In earlier versions, the event was not raised for resource assemblies. If the operating system is localized, the handler might be called multiple times: once for each culture in the fallback chain.       Every derived class of <xref:System.Delegate> and <xref:System.MulticastDelegate> has a constructor and an `Invoke` method. See the C++ code example in the description for the <xref:System.Delegate> class."
