  summary: "Represents the method that specifies a local Internet Protocol address and port number for a <xref href=&quot;System.Net.ServicePoint&quot;></xref>."
  remarks: "Specify that the BindIPEndPoint delegate is used by a <xref:System.Net.ServicePoint> by setting the <xref:System.Net.ServicePoint.BindIPEndPointDelegate%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property with the delegate as an argument. This delegate should specify a local IP address and port number in the returned <xref:System.Net.IPEndPoint>.       If the .NET Framework cannot bind the returned <xref:System.Net.IPEndPoint> to the <xref:System.Net.ServicePoint> after <xref:System.Int32.MaxValue?displayProperty=fullName> attempts, an <xref:System.OverflowException> is thrown.       If you want the delegate to give the service point control of the connection binding, the delegate should return `null`. If you want to abort the connection, the delegate must throw an exception."
