  summary: "Represents the method that handles the <see cref=&quot;E:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemDeleting&quot;></see> event of a <see cref=&quot;T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView&quot;></see> control."
  remarks: "The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemDeleting> event when a Delete button (a button with its `CommandName` property set to &quot;Delete&quot;) within the control is clicked, but before the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control deletes the record. This allows you to provide an event-handling method that performs a custom routine, such as verifying a record before deleting it, whenever this event occurs.       When you create a FormViewDeleteEventHandler delegate, you identify the method that will handle the event. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The event handler is called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the delegate. For more information about event-handler delegates, see [NIB: Events and Delegates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d98fd58b-fa4f-4598-8378-addf4355a115)."
