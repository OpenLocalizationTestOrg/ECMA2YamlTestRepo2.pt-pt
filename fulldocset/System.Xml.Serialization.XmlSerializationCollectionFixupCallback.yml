  summary: "Delegate used by the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> class for deserialization of SOAP-encoded XML data types that map to collections or enumerations."
  remarks: "During initialization, the .NET Framework XML serialization infrastructure dynamically generates and compiles a temporary class for deserialization derived from the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializationReader> class. During this process, the .NET Framework generates collection fix-up methods that use the XmlSerializationCollectionFixupCallback delegate. This occurs for SOAP-encoded arrays or SOAP-encoded, multi-reference elements whose data types, in either case, map to .NET Framework collections or enumerations. As necessary, the collection fix-up method is called during deserialization.       You should not directly instantiate XmlSerializationCollectionFixupCallback.       SOAP encoding is described in Section 5 of the SOAP 1.1 specification."
