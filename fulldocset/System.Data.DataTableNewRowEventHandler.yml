  summary: "Represents the method that handles the &lt;xref:System.Data.DataTable.NewRow%2A&gt; method."
  remarks: 'When you create a DataTableNewRowEventHandler delegate, you identify the method that will handle the event. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The event handler is called whenever the event occurs until you remove the delegate. For more information about delegates, see [NIB: Events and Delegates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d98fd58b-fa4f-4598-8378-addf4355a115).'
