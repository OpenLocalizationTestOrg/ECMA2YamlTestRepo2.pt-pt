  type: Delegate
  summary: "Represents a method that can handle events which may or may not require further processing after the event handler has returned."
  remarks: "This delegate is available for use with your own events when the <xref:System.ComponentModel.HandledEventArgs.Handled%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property provides sufficient event data. The event handler can set the <xref:System.ComponentModel.HandledEventArgs.Handled%2A> property to `true` if all necessary processing has been completed in the handler.       Typically, events that require this functionality will also require additional event data, and will use a class that derives from <xref:System.ComponentModel.HandledEventArgs> along with a corresponding, similarly-named delegate type. For example, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.RowPrePaint?displayProperty=fullName> event uses the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRowPrePaintEventArgs> event-data type and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRowPrePaintEventHandler> delegate type. Because delegates are not inherited, the HandledEventHandler is rarely used."
