  summary: "Defines the information for the endpoint resolution of a registration entry by a peer resolver service."
  remarks: "This class represents information sent from a peer node to a peer resolver service when requesting the endpoints for a specific peer node registered with the service.       Instances of this class are primarily used to pass endpoint resolution information to the resolver service from a network client of that service."
