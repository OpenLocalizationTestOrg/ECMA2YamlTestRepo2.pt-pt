  summary: "Provides methods for passing credentials across a stream and requesting or performing authentication for client-server applications."
  remarks: "This abstract class provides methods and properties that are common to authenticated streams.       Authenticated streams can provide authentication, data signing, and encryption services that can help maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data transmitted using the <xref:System.Net.Security.AuthenticatedStream.InnerStream%2A>.       The security protocol implemented by a class that derives from AuthenticatedStream together with the security protocols supported on the client and server will determine the security features that are available to an application. The <xref:System.Net.Security.NegotiateStream> and <xref:System.Net.Security.SslStream> classes inherit from AuthenticatedStream and implement the Negotiate and Secure Sockets Layer security protocols, respectively."
