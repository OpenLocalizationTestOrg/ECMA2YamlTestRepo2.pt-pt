  summary: "Initializes a new instance of the <see cref=&quot;T:System.Windows.Xps.Packaging.PackagingProgressEventArgs&quot;></see> class."
  remarks: "In certain situations and for specific types, multiple packaging progress events occur at the same time. These logically distinct, but temporally identical, events are combined into a single <xref:System.Windows.Xps.Serialization.XpsPackagingPolicy.PackagingProgressEvent> and `numberCompleted` is more than 1. For example, when you print, font subsetting is performed every four pages. Each page must be cached until the subsetting is complete, and then all four <xref:System.Windows.Xps.Packaging.PackagingAction> events occur at the same time. The constructor for the resulting <xref:System.Windows.Xps.Packaging.PackagingProgressEventArgs> sets `action` to <xref:System.Windows.Xps.Packaging.PackagingAction> and sets `numberCompleted` to 4.       For example, if a package consists of a single four-page document that uses one font and no images or other resources, the sequence of events might occur as shown in the following table.       **The sequence of events for a simple package**       AddingDocumentSequence    1       AddingFixedDocument    1       AddingFixedPage    1       AddingFixedPage    1       AddingFixedPage    1       AddingFixedPage    1       FontAdded    1       FixedPageCompleted    4       FixedDocumentCompleted    1       DocumentSequenceCompleted    1       XpsDocumentCommitted    1"
