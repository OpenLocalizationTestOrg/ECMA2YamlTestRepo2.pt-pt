  summary: "Represents the method that handles the <xref href=&quot;System.Windows.Xps.XpsDocumentWriter.WritingPrintTicketRequired&quot;></xref> event of an <xref href=&quot;System.Windows.Xps.XpsDocumentWriter&quot;></xref>."
  remarks: "This event occurs when the <xref:System.Windows.Xps.XpsDocumentWriter> needs the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> of a print job.       When you create a WritingPrintTicketRequiredEventHandler delegate, you identify the method that handles the event. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The event handler is called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the delegate. For more information about event-handler delegates, see [NIB: Events and Delegates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d98fd58b-fa4f-4598-8378-addf4355a115)."
