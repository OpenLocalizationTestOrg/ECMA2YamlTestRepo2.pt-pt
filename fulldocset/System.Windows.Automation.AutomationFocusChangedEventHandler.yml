  summary: "Represents the method implemented by the UI Automation client application to handle the event raised by a UI Automation provider when the focus has changed."
  remarks: "Use an AutomationFocusChangedEventHandler delegate to define the method that is called by a client to handle [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] focus-changed events.       The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement> represented by `sender` might not have any cached properties or patterns, depending on whether the application subscribed to this event while a <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest> was active."
