  summary: "Represents the method that will handle the <xref href=&quot;System.Web.UI.MobileControls.List.ItemCommand&quot;></xref> event of a <xref href=&quot;System.Web.UI.MobileControls.List&quot;></xref>. For information about how to develop ASP.NET mobile applications, see the [www.asp.net/mobile](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=182900) Web site."
  remarks: "When you create a ListCommandEventHandler delegate for a <xref:System.Web.UI.MobileControls.List> control, you identify the method that will handle the event. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ListControl> notifies the handler when an item event is generated. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. Unless you remove the delegate, the event handler is called whenever the event occurs.       For default rendering, the control provides a UI that allows the user to click individual list items. On postback, the control calls the <xref:System.Web.UI.MobileControls.List.OnItemCommand%2A> event handler, with an argument pointing to the source item. The value of the <xref:System.Web.UI.MobileControls.Command.CommandName%2A> property is `null`.       When rendering with a template, the event bubbling mechanism of ASP.NET calls the <xref:System.Web.UI.MobileControls.List.OnItemCommand%2A> method. The event handler is passed a parameter, pointing to the source item, and to the <xref:System.Web.UI.MobileControls.Command.CommandName%2A> property of the control that generated the event. This allows you to render a single list item with multiple associated interactions.       To render an item as a hyperlink, you can set the <xref:System.Web.UI.MobileControls.List.ItemsAsLinks%2A> property to `true`. The value of the <xref:System.Web.UI.MobileControls.MobileListItem.Text%2A> property is used for display, and the contents of the <xref:System.Web.UI.MobileControls.MobileListItem.Value%2A> property are used as the target link address when selected.      > [!NOTE] >  Command events will not be generated for these links."
