  summary: "Delegate used by the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> class for deserialization of types from SOAP-encoded, non-root XML data."
  remarks: "During initialization, the .NET Framework XML serialization infrastructure dynamically generates and compiles a temporary class for deserialization derived from the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializationReader> class. During this process, the .NET Framework generates read methods that implement the XmlSerializationReadCallback delegate. It does so for certain mappings between .NET Framework types and XML data types that are serialized through SOAP-encoded XML and are not root elements. Then, as necessary, a read method is called during deserialization.       Do not directly create instances of the XmlSerializationReadCallback class.       SOAP encoding is described in Section 5 of the SOAP 1.1 specification."
