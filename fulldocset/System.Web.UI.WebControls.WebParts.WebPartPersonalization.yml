  summary: "Implements low-level personalization operations."
  remarks: "This class implements the logic required to carry out lower-level personalization operations. Although the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class manages the high-level life cycle of personalization, it is the WebPartPersonalization class that is responsible for actually implementing the physical steps necessary to carry out specific personalization actions. The WebPartPersonalization class in turn relies on an implementation of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationProvider> to communicate with the underlying data store for personalization information.       If you use the default implementation of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager>, it creates an instance of the WebPartPersonalization class that you can use by referencing the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Personalization%2A> property. For example, to access the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartPersonalization.InitialScope%2A> property, you would specify `WebPartManager.Personalization.InitialScope`."
  example:
  - "The following code example shows how the WebPartPersonalization class is used, as well as providing an example of how personalization scope affects the results of personalized properties. This example has five files:  \n  \n-   An .aspx page that declaratively creates two Web Part zones, each with a control.  \n  \n-   A user control called `Color.ascx` that allows a user to change a personalized property that applies a text box background color based on the user's authorization rights to modify state information and to enter shared scope.  \n  \n-   A user control called `Persmode.ascx` that indicates what the current page scope is and what rights the current user has to enter shared scope or to modify data; it also provides two buttons; one to change scope and one to reset current user personalization information.  \n  \n-   A login control that is used to authorize users.  \n  \n-   A Web.config file with a section that provides an example of authorizing a user to modify personalization state and to enter shared scope.  \n  \n The following code creates an aspx page  with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> and two Web Part zones and displays the `Color.ascx` and `Persmode.ascx` controls. The page loads a login page that is used to get the current user information. Use the ASP.NET Web Site Administration Tool in [!INCLUDE[vsprvsext](~/add/includes/vsprvsext-md.md)] to create users to access the page. See the Web.config file for an example of a user granted authorization in the configuration file to change scope and modify state information.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartPersonalization#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_306_1.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartPersonalization#1](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_306_1.aspx)]  \n  \n The following example code creates a login page. After a successful login, it redirects to the main aspx page.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  This example has a text box that accepts user input, which is a potential security threat. By default, ASP.NET Web pages validate that user input does not include script or HTML elements. For more information, see [Script Exploits Overview](../Topic/Script%20Exploits%20Overview.md).  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartPersonalization#5](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_306_2.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartPersonalization#5](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_306_2.aspx)]  \n  \n The following example code is a portion of the Web.config file for this application. This section shows how to set authorization for a user, in this case \"user2\", to enter shared personalization scope and to modify personalization state information. It also shows an example of a role, in this case \"admin\", that can be used to allow users in the \"admin\" role to enter shared personalization scope and to modify personalization state information.  \n  \n [!CODE [WebParts_WebPartPersonalization#2](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartPersonalization#2)]  \n  \n The following example code creates a user control, called `Color.ascx`, that allows the user to change a personalized property, in this case the background color of two text boxes, based on the current personalization scope and the authorization rights of the user.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  This example has a text box that accepts user input, which is a potential security threat.
