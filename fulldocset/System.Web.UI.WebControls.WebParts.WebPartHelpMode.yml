  summary: "Specifies the available types of user interfaces (UIs) for displaying Help content for a <xref href=&quot;System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart&quot;></xref> control."
  remarks: "The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.HelpMode%2A> property is used to determine how a browser will display Help content for a control. The WebPartHelpMode enumeration contains values that can be applied to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.HelpMode%2A> property. The default value for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.HelpMode%2A> property is Modal."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates the use of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.HelpMode%2A> property to display Help for a control in the same browser window. The first part of this example assumes the use of a custom control, `TextDisplayWebPart`, which is found in the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class overview.  \n  \n The code example also includes an HTML page that contains fictitious Help content for the `TextDisplayWebPart` control. For this example to work, you must save the following code in a file named Textwebparthelp.htm and place it in the same directory of your site as the .aspx page.  \n  \n```  \n<html>  \n<head runat=\"server\">  \n    <title>Text Content WebPart Help</title>  \n</head>  \n<body>  \n  <div>  \n  <h1>Text Content WebPart Help</h1>  \n  To make the WebPart control work...  \n  </div>  \n</body>  \n</html>  \n```  \n  \n The final part of the example is a Web page that shows how to reference the `TextDisplayWebPart` control. Note that in the declarative markup, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.HelpMode%2A> property value is set to Navigate, and the code also sets the value of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.HelpUrl%2A> property to the name of the HTML file that contains the Help content. Load the page into a browser, and click the help verb on the verbs menu of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPart_HelpMode#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_134_1.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPart_HelpMode#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_134_1.aspx)]"
