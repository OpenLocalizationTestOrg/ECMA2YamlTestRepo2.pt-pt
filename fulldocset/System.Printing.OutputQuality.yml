  summary: "Specifies the types of output quality for a print device."
  remarks: "Use the values of this type primarily for these purposes:      -   As members of the <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities.OutputQualityCapability%2A> collection, which is a property of <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities>, these values indicate the types of output quality that a printer supports.      -   As the value of the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket.OutputQuality%2A> property of a <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket>, they direct a printer to produce a particular quality.       The `Unknown` value is never used in properties of <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities> objects.       You should never set a <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> property to `Unknown`. If some other <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> producing application has created a *PrintTicket document* that sets the output quality feature to an unrecognized option (that is, an option that is not defined in the [Print Schema](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186397)), then a <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> object in your application that is constructed with that document will have `Unknown` as the value of the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket.OutputQuality%2A> property.       Although the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> and <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities> classes cannot be inherited, you can extend the [Print Schema](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186397) to recognize print device features that are not accounted for in the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> or <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities> classes. For more information see [NOTINBUILD: How to: Extend the Print Schema and Create New Print System Classes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/a3600218-1ea5-478a-9853-6560464f2885).      <a name=&quot;Photographic&quot;></a>    ## Notes on OutputQuality.Photographic    Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](~/add/includes/net-v461-md.md)], the output quality obtained with the Photographic value is improved (compared to previous versions of the .NET Framework) when printing to a GDI-based printer and when running on Windows 7 and earlier versions of the Windows operating system.       Producing documents with better output quality requires larger print spooler files and longer wait times. If these side effects are undesirable, you can instead use the  High value."
