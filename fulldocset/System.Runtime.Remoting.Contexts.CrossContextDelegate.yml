  summary: "Represents the method that will handle the requests of execution of some code in another context."
  remarks: "Callbacks provide a facility to request execution of some code in another context. The CrossContextDelegate class is defined for context callbacks. Each context has a callback object that can be used to perform callbacks on the context. The delegate used to request a callback through the callback object must be of the CrossContextDelegate class."
