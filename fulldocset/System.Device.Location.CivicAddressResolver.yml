  summary: "Provides functionality for resolving a coordinate-based location to a civic address."
  remarks: "The CivicAddressResolver class provides an implementation of <xref:System.Device.Location.ICivicAddressResolver> that resolves a coordinate-based location to a civic address if the location provider provides both coordinates and civic address data."
  example:
  - "The following program shows how to call <xref:System.Device.Location.CivicAddressResolver.ResolveAddress%2A> to resolve a civic address synchronously.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Device.Location.ResolveCivicAddressSync#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/resolveaddresssync/resolvecivicaddresssync.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Device.Location.ResolveCivicAddressSync#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/resolvecivicaddresssync/resolvecivicaddresssync.vb#1)]  \n  \n The following program shows how to call <xref:System.Device.Location.CivicAddressResolver.ResolveAddressAsync%2A> to resolve a civic address asynchronously.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Device.Location.ResolveCivicAddressSync#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/resolveaddresssync/resolvecivicaddresssync.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Device.Location.ResolveCivicAddressSync#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/resolvecivicaddresssync/resolvecivicaddresssync.vb#1)]"
