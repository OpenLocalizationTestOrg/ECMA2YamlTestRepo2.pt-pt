  type: Class
  summary: "Contains a collection of <see cref=&quot;T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart&quot;></see> controls used to track and manage related groups of controls. This class cannot be inherited."
  remarks: "The WebPartCollection class is a read-only collection of controls, typically used by <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> controls to manage sets of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls.       A <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control uses a WebPartCollection object to keep a list of all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls on a page, whereas a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> control uses a WebPartCollection object to track the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that it contains.      > [!NOTE] >  The WebPartCollection collection contains both <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls and other server controls (such as user controls, custom controls, and ASP.NET controls) that are placed in <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zones and used as part of Web Parts applications. So, for example, if you have a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> zone in a page, and within it you declare a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control and the ASP.NET <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Calendar> control, both controls will be in the WebPartCollection collection referenced by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebParts%2A> property.       The WebPartCollection object exists so that the Web Parts control set can work with strongly typed collections. Similarly, if you want to perform mass operations on a set of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, you can get a reference to a WebPartCollection object using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebParts%2A> property. For example, you might want to loop through all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls on a page and change their appearance in some way. Even though the WebPartCollection object is read-only, you can make programmatic changes to the properties of the underlying controls referenced in the collection."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates the use of the WebPartCollection object on a Web Parts page. This example has three parts:  \n  \n-   The code for the page in a partial class.  \n  \n-   The Web page that contains the controls.  \n  \n-   A description of how the example works in a browser.  \n  \n The first part of the code example contains the code for the page in a partial class. Note that the `Button1_Click` method creates a WebPartCollection object that consists of all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls referenced in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebParts%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property, which includes all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls on the page. The method iterates through all the controls, and toggles each control's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ChromeState%2A> property, which determines whether that control is normal or minimized.  \n  \n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartCollection_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_100_1.vb)]\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartCollection_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_100_1.cs)]  \n  \n The second part of the code example is the Web page that contains the controls. Notice that the controls declared in `WebPartZone1` are standard ASP.NET server controls, but because they are wrapped as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> controls at run time, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> class inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class, the controls are automatically treated as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls at run time and therefore are included in the WebPartCollection object.  \n  \n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartCollection_Overview#2](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_100_2.aspx)]\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartCollection_Overview#2](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_100_2.aspx)]  \n  \n After you load the page in a browser and click the **Toggle ChromeState** button, the code in the partial class loops through the WebPartCollection object and alternately minimizes the controls or returns them to normal. Or, if you repeatedly click the **Toggle BulletedList1 Title** button, the title of the uppermost control is changed to alternate values."
