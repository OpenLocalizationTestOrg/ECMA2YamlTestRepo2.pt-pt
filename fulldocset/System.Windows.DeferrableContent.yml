  summary: "Represents deferrable content that is held within BAML as a stream."
  remarks: "Deferrable content is precompiled or processed XAML that has not yet been parsed. Deferrable content is exposed as an object for advanced scenarios.       DeferrableContent has an internal constructor. There is an instantiation  pathway through <xref:System.Windows.DeferrableContentConverter>, where you pass in a stream. You would only use DeferrableContent if you are using <xref:System.Windows.Baml2006.Baml2006Reader> for stream processing. This is an advanced scenario where you may have to implement many of the supporting XAML services yourself."
