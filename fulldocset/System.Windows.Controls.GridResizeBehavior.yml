If the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter.ResizeDirection%2A> property specifies that space is redistributed between columns, the redistribution follows these guidelines:      -   When the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Left>, space is redistributed between the column that is specified for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> and the column that is to the left.      -   When the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Right>, space is redistributed between the column that is specified for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> and the column that is to the right.      -   When the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Center>, space is redistributed between the columns that are to the left and right of the column that is specified for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter>.      -   When the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Stretch>, space is redistributed between the columns that are to the left and right of the column that is specified for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter>."
