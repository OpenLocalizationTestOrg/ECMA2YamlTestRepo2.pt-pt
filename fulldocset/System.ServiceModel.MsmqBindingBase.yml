  summary: "Gets or sets an enumeration value that indicates the type of dead-letter queue to use."
  remarks: "The dead-letter queue is a queue on the queue manager of the sending application for expired messages that have failed to be delivered. The dead-letter queue enumeration specifies the type of dead-letter queue to use. The values are:      -   `None`: No dead-letter queue is required. If a message fails delivery, no record of it is maintained in the dead-letter queue. This is the default value when <xref:System.ServiceModel.MsmqBindingBase.ExactlyOnce%2A> is set to `false`.      -   `System`: The system-wide dead-letter queue is used to record messages that fail delivery. Message Queuing (MSMQ) has a transactional, system, dead-letter queue and a non-transactional, system, dead-letter queue to record messages that fail delivery from transactional and non-transactional queues, respectively. This is the default value when <xref:System.ServiceModel.MsmqBindingBase.ExactlyOnce%2A> is set to `true`.      -   `Custom`: The queue specified in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.MsmqBindingBase.CustomDeadLetterQueue%2A> property that is used to record messages that fail delivery.       The reasons a message can fail to reach the receiving application include:      -   A transactional message is sent to a non-transactional queue.      -   A non-transactional message is sent to a transactional queue.      -   An unauthenticated message is sent to a queue that accepts only authenticated messages.      -   An unencrypted message is sent to a queue that accepts only encrypted messages.      -   The message expires before the message is delivered to a receiver.      -   The message storage quota of the target computer or the storage quota of the destination queue is exceeded, or there is no available storage space on the target computer when the message arrives.      -   The sender does not have the [access rights](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=96167) required to place the message in the destination queue.      -   The digital signature attached to the message is not valid.      -   An encrypted message cannot be decrypted by the destination queue manager.      -   The destination queue is purged or deleted before the message is retrieved."
