  summary: "Defines the modes of security that can be used to configure a service endpoint to receive HTTP requests."
  remarks: "Use this enumeration to specify whether transport-level security is used by an endpoint configured with a <xref:System.ServiceModel.WebHttpBinding> to receive HTTP requests. The default value is None, which indicates that no security is used.       If the Transport value is specified by the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WebHttpBinding.%23ctor%28System.ServiceModel.WebHttpSecurityMode%29>, then the settings provided by the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WebHttpSecurity.Transport%2A> property become effective for the service endpoint. The value of WebHttpSecurityMode can only be set in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WebHttpBinding> constructor that takes it as an explicit parameter and its value cannot be set again after the binding instance is created.       TransportCredentialOnly does not provide message integrity and confidentiality. It provides HTTP-based client authentication only. This mode should be used with caution. It should be used in environments, such at IPSec, where the transport security is being provided by other means and only client authentication is provided by the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] infrastructure."
