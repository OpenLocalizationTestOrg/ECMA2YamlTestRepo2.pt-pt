  summary: "Defines constants that specify the direction in which consecutive user interface (UI) elements are placed in a linear layout container"
  remarks: "The FlowDirection enumeration describes the flow direction of consecutive UI elements, typically controls, on a design surface or container such as a form. This enumeration is used by linear layout containers such as <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel>, which stores this information internally in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel.FlowDirection%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.       The FlowDirection determines where a new control is placed by default when it is added to a supporting container. The flow direction of the container, along with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> properties of each contained control, determine the rearrangement of controls when their container is resized.       The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control provides a `FlowBreak` property to its child controls. Setting the value of the `FlowBreak` property to `true` causes the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control to stop laying out controls in the current flow direction and wrap to the next row or column."
  example:
  - "The following example shows how to set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel.FlowDirection%2A> property on a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control. This code example is part of a larger example provided for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel#4](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.windows.forms.f_6_1.cs)]\n [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel#4](~/add/codesnippet/CPP/t-system.windows.forms.f_6_1.cpp)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel#4](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.windows.forms.f_6_1.vb)]"
