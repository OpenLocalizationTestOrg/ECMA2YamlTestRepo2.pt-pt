  summary: "Specifies whether all, some, or none of a <xref href=&quot;System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart&quot;></xref> control&quot;s properties can be exported."
  remarks: "A value from the WebPartExportMode enumerator can be applied to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ExportMode%2A> property to specify which properties from a Web Parts control can be exported. By default, the properties of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control cannot be exported and the control&quot;s <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ExportMode%2A> property is set to None. To enable exporting all properties for the control, set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ExportMode%2A> value to All. To export only certain properties while preventing the export of properties that contain sensitive data, you set the property value to NonSensitiveData.       A property can be marked as sensitive through the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizableAttribute> attribute.      > [!NOTE] >  To enable the export feature for a Web application that includes Web Parts controls, in the Web.config file for your application, you must add an attribute to the `<webParts>` element within the `<system.web>` section, as in the following markup.   >    >  `<webParts enableExport=&quot;true&quot;>`   >    >  `</webParts>`"
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates the use of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ExportMode%2A> property. Note that for the export code example to work, you must also update your Web.config file as indicated in the Remarks section.  \n  \n The first part of this example contains the code for a control named `TextDisplayWebPart`. This control is the same as the custom control that is found in the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class overview, except that it adds a `Personalizable` attribute to the `TextDisplayWebPart.ContentText` property so the property can be exported. Note that the attribute declaration includes a value of `true` for the `isSensitive` parameter, meaning that the property is marked as sensitive data for export purposes. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This code example assumes that you compile the source code into an assembly, place it in a Bin subfolder of your Web application, and reference the assembly with a `Register` directive in your Web page. For a walkthrough that demonstrates both methods of compiling, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPart_ExportMode#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_32_1.vb)]\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPart_ExportMode#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_32_1.cs)]  \n  \n The second part of the example shows how to reference the `TextDisplayWebPart` control in an ASP.NET Web page. Note that in the declarative markup, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ExportMode%2A> property value is set to All, meaning that even properties with sensitive values will be exported.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPart_ExportMode#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_32_2.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPart_ExportMode#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_32_2.aspx)]  \n  \n Load the Web page in a browser, and on the verbs menu of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, click the export verb and follow the instructions to export a description file containing the control's state and property data."
