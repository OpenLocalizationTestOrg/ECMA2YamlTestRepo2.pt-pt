  summary: "Represents an item to embed in an e-mail message constructed using the <xref href=&quot;System.Web.UI.WebControls.MailDefinition&quot;></xref> class."
  remarks: "The EmbeddedMailObject represents an item to embed in a mail message. These embedded items can be image files such as company logos. Each embedded item is specified by an identifier and a path.       To ensure that an embedded object is displayed correctly within the e-mail message file, the following conditions must be met:      -   The mail message is in HTML format.      -   The item is an image file (.jpg, .gif, .bmp, and so on).      -   The HTML-formatted body file specified in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.MailDefinition.BodyFileName%2A> property contains a reference to the image file using the following syntax:          ```       <img src=&quot;cid:identifier&quot; alt=&quot;Alternate Text&quot; />.       ```       If an EmbeddedMailObject is added to a mail message and does not fulfill all of the requirements specified previously, it will most likely be displayed as an attachment in the mail message. If an item is referenced by an identifier in the mail message but not included as an embedded item, it will appear as a broken attachment when the mail is viewed.       The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.EmbeddedMailObjectsCollection> stores a collection of EmbeddedMailObject objects for a single mail message. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.EmbeddedMailObjectsCollection> is used by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.MailDefinition.EmbeddedObjects%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.MailDefinition> object to create the mail message.       Mail messages that allow embedded objects are configurable in the following Web controls by setting their <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.MailDefinition> properties declaratively:      -   <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.CreateUserWizard>      -   <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ChangePassword>      -   <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.PasswordRecovery>      > [!NOTE] >  The values in the EmbeddedMailObject and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.EmbeddedMailObjectsCollection> objects are not stored in view state. This protects against malicious users discovering path information for your server."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates an ASP.NET page that uses a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ChangePassword> Web control, and includes an event handler for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ChangePassword.SendingMail> event named `SendingMail`. The code example assumes that the ASP.NET Web site has been configured to use ASP.NET membership and Forms authentication, and that a user has been created whose name and password are known to you. For more information, see [How to: Implement Simple Forms Authentication](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n If the password change succeeds, the code in the `SendingMail` event handler attempts to send an e-mail message to the user to confirm the change. SMTP must already be configured on the server in order for this code example to work. For information about how to configure an SMTP server, see [NIB: How to: Install and Configure SMTP Virtual Servers in IIS 6.0](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ed204b58-24af-47d0-9687-60e5df5f17f8). For the purposes of this example, it is not necessary to configure an SMTP server; the example is constructed to test for a failure to send an e-mail message.  \n  \n If a mail server is not configured correctly or some other error occurs and the e-mail message cannot be sent, the `SendMailError` function is called. A message is displayed to the user. In addition, an event is logged to the Windows Application event log with the assumption that an event source named MySamplesSite already exists.
