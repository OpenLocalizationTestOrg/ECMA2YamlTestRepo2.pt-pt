  summary: "Provides a base class for a derived custom type that monitors changes in the state of the data which a cache item depends on."
  remarks: "The ChangeMonitor class is used as the base class for derived monitor classes that are specialized for particular cache implementations. A ChangeMonitor instance monitors changes in the state of data which a cache item depends on. For example, the item can be a file or data entity whose contents are cached. If the file or data entity is updated, the associated cache entry must be changed also. Common items that can be monitored include data entities (such as database fields, values, rows, or tables), another cache entry, and files and file attributes.       A dependency change is a change in the state of a dependency. In a typical cache implementation, after a ChangeMonitor instance notifies the cache that a dependency has changed, the cache performs the required action, such as invalidating the inserted cache entry.       Derived ChangeMonitor classes can be customized to monitor dependency changes for specific different data stores. For example, there are cache implementations for a file system, physical memory, or a database. The ChangeMonitor class examines changes that occur outside the cache, and then alerts the cache that changes have occurred.       The [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/add/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] includes the following classes that derive from ChangeMonitor class:      -   <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.CacheEntryChangeMonitor>      -   <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.FileChangeMonitor>      -   <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.HostFileChangeMonitor>      -   <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.SqlChangeMonitor>       Each of these classes works with different types of dependencies. For example, the derived <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.FileChangeMonitor> class monitors changes to a cache for file system data (files and folders) that the cache item depends on."

  remarks: "The Dispose method invokes the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.Dispose%2A> method of derived classes only one time, the first time it is called. Subsequent calls to the Dispose method have no effect. After the method has been called, the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.IsDisposed%2A> property is set to `true`.       The <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.Dispose%2A> overload must be called to dispose of a <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor> instance. The following are the rules for calling the dispose method:      -   Before an item is inserted into the cache, it is the caller&quot;s responsibility to dispose of a <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor> instance.      -   Once cache item and the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor> instances that are associated with it are passed to a cache, the cache implementer that must make sure that <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.Dispose%2A> is called, even if the insert fails.      -   After an item and its associated <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor> instances are passed to a cache, the caller must not dispose the dependency because when the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.Dispose%2A> method is called, the call is treated as if the dependency has changed. As a result, the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.OnChanged%2A> method is automatically invoked.      -   Taking these rules into consideration, the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.Dispose%2A> method must be called in one of the following ways:          -   Users must call the Dispose method overload if they decide not to insert the derived change-monitor instance into a cache.          -   The cache implementation is responsible for calling the Dispose overload if the implementation tries to insert the change-monitor instance into an object cache but the insertion fails. When the insertion attempt causes an exception, the cache implementation must dispose any associated dependencies.          -   If the cache entry is removed, the cache implementation must also dispose the dependency.       The internal implementation of the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.OnChanged%2A> method automatically calls the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.Dispose%2A> method after it calls a callback that is registered through the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.NotifyOnChanged%2A> method.      > [!NOTE] >  This automatic dispose during the event firing only occurs if the initialization of the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor> instance previously completed.       When a derived change monitor&quot;s constructor calls the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.InitializationComplete%2A> method, if the state of the change monitor has already changed (that is, the state that is monitored has already changed when the constructor was still active) then <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.InitializationComplete%2A> method will automatically dispose the change monitor.      > [!NOTE] >  Users should not call the Dispose method. However, you cannot prevent users from calling the method. Therefore, if they do, the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.OnChanged%2A> method is invoked. In that case, the cache entry is notified as if the dependency has changed.       To prevent derived classes from overriding Dispose method, the method is not an explicit interface implementation."

  remarks: "Cache implementers use this method to wire themselves up to a change monitor. If you associate one or more change monitors with the cache item, you pass a <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.CacheItemPolicy> instance with a populated change monitors property to the cache item. A cache implementer that supports change monitors is responsible for iterating over the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.CacheItemPolicy.ChangeMonitors%2A> property and register the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.OnChangedCallback> delegates with each change monitor that it finds.       Because the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.OnChangedCallback> delegate includes an optional state parameter, a concrete change monitor implementation can pass optional state information. The cache implementer determines whether an explicit dependency on the type of state that a custom change monitor passes as part of the callback can be taken.      > [!NOTE] >  The base cache extensibility API has no requirement for explicit dependency on the type of state.       The implementation of the NotifyOnChanged method automatically determines whether the state of the monitor has already changed at the time NotifyOnChanged method is called.

This occurs because it is possible that from the time a cache implementation creates a change monitor, to the time a cache implementation gets the monitor and wires itself up to it, the underlying monitored state has changed. If the state has already changed then the object that is passed to the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.OnChanged%2A> method is `null`.
