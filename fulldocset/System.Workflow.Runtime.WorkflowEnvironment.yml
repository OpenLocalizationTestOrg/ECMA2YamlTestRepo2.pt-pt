  remarks: "> [!NOTE] >  [!INCLUDE[DeprecatedContent](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)]       The WorkflowEnvironment represents the transactional environment of the workflow instance that is running on the current thread. WorkflowEnvironment has two properties: the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowEnvironment.WorkBatch%2A> property, which exposes the current work batch and allows a host or a host service to participate in the current transaction by adding <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.IPendingWork> items to this property; and the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowEnvironment.WorkflowInstanceId%2A> property, which exposes the <xref:System.Guid> of the workflow instance currently running on this thread."

  remarks: "The WorkBatch property allows hosts or host services to participate in the current transaction by adding pending work items to the current work batch. A host or a host service that wants to participate in the current transaction must implement the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.IPendingWork> interface and use <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.IWorkBatch.Add%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to add pending work items to WorkBatch. Durable services should add items to WorkBatch to keep the state of their data stores consistent with the state of the workflow instance. The out-of-box durable services, <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.SqlTrackingService> and <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.SqlWorkflowPersistenceService>, both implement this functionality."
