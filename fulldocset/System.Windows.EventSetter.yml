  summary: "Represents an event setter in a style. Event setters invoke the specified event handlers in response to events."
  remarks: "Event setters invoke the specified event handlers in response to routed events, which apply to all elements that reference the <xref:System.Windows.Style> rather than requiring you to attach instance handlers to each individual element. Only <xref:System.Windows.Style.Setters%2A?displayProperty=fullName> support EventSetter objects.       You can only declare event setters for events that are routed events. You can declare event setters for routed events with a direct routing strategy, bubbling events, or tunneling events.       Instances of the EventSetter class are usually created through [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)], as an object element within a style defined through [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]. An EventSetter might also be instantiated from code.       Event setters cannot be used in a style that is contained in a theme resource dictionary. This is because a theme resource dictionary at run time is often loose [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_baml](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-baml-md.md)] files, and does not have any scope defined where accompanying code-behind that defines the handlers can exist.       Handlers attached through event setters are invoked after any class handlers for an event, and also after any instance handlers. As a result, if a class handler or instance handler marks an event handled in its arguments, then the handler declared by an event setter is not invoked, unless the event setter specifically sets <xref:System.Windows.EventSetter.HandledEventsToo%2A> `true`.       Event setters may also come from <xref:System.Windows.Style.BasedOn%2A> styles. The event setter handlers from the style specified as <xref:System.Windows.Style.BasedOn%2A> will be invoked after the handlers on the immediate style.       Note that only <xref:System.Windows.Style.Setters%2A?displayProperty=fullName> supports EventSetter objects. Triggers (<xref:System.Windows.TriggerBase> and derived classes) do not support EventSetter."
