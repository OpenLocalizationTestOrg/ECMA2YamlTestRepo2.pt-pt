  summary: "Creates a COM object."
  remarks: "This delegate is called to create a COM object as an alternative to `CoCreateInstance` when a managed object needs to create a new instance of its unmanaged portion. The `IUnknown` interface of the managed object is passed as a parameter and the delegate should return the `IUnknown` interface of the unmanaged object. Both interfaces are passed as type <xref:System.IntPtr> to avoid marshaling.       Every derived class of <xref:System.Delegate> and <xref:System.MulticastDelegate> has a constructor and an `Invoke` method."
