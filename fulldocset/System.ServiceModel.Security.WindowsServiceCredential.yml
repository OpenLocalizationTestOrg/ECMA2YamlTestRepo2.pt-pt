  summary: "Provides properties that describe the service credentials used for Windows authentication."
  remarks: "This class provides two settings.       You can use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.WindowsServiceCredential.AllowAnonymousLogons%2A> property to allow the anonymous logon of clients by setting it to `true`. You can then avoid disclosing the client&quot;s identity to the service by setting <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.WindowsClientCredential.AllowedImpersonationLevel%2A> to `Anonymous`.      -   If the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.WindowsServiceCredential.IncludeWindowsGroups%2A> property is set to `true` (the default setting), the service can determine the Windows groups to which the client belongs."

  summary: "Gets or sets a value that indicates whether to allowanonymous users access (applies only to message-level security)."
  remarks: "When using Windows client credentials on a binding, by default the system does not allow anonymous access. This means that only domain or workgroup authenticated users are allowed into the system. However, in certain cases it is acceptable for anonymous, unauthenticated users to access the service. In this case you can set this property to `true` to allow anonymous clients to call the service. A service that enables anonymous authentication is significantly loosening the security requirements, so this setting should be used with caution.       Note that this property does not apply to transport security scenarios and applies only when message security is used by the underlying binding to secure the messages. If Windows transport security is used, this property does not apply."

  summary: "Gets or sets a value that indicates whether the Windows groups that a client belongs to are included in the security context."
  remarks: "In most scenarios, knowing which Windows groups users belong to provides useful information for authorization decisions. However, if the Windows groups are not required, setting this property to `false` can improve performance by avoiding a full-group claim population."
