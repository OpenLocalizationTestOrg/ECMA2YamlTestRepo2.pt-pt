  summary: "Represents the method that will handle mouse related routed events that do not specifically involve mouse buttons or the mouse wheel; for example, <xref href=&quot;System.Windows.UIElement.MouseMove&quot;></xref>."
  remarks: "This delegate is used with the following attached events:      -   <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.GotMouseCapture?displayProperty=fullName>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.LostMouseCapture?displayProperty=fullName>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseEnter?displayProperty=fullName>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseLeave?displayProperty=fullName>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseMove?displayProperty=fullName>      -   <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.PreviewMouseMove?displayProperty=fullName>       This delegate is used with the following routed events. These routed events forward the previously listed attached events to make them more accessible to the general element model in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)].      -   <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseEnter?displayProperty=fullName>      -   <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeave?displayProperty=fullName>      -   <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseMove?displayProperty=fullName>      -   <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewMouseMove?displayProperty=fullName>      -   <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement.MouseEnter?displayProperty=fullName>      -   <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement.MouseLeave?displayProperty=fullName>      -   <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement.MouseMove?displayProperty=fullName>      -   <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement.PreviewMouseMove?displayProperty=fullName>       The attached events and the base element routed events share their event data, and the bubbling and tunneling versions of the routed events also share event data. This can affect the handled characteristics of the event as it travels the event route. For details, see [Input Overview](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       Other than the <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs> properties that are relevant for all routed events, the most interesting properties of <xref:System.Windows.Input.MouseEventArgs> that you might use in a MouseEventHandler implementation are several properties that expose the current button state, such as <xref:System.Windows.Input.MouseEventArgs.LeftButton%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Input.MouseEventArgs.MouseDevice%2A>. <xref:System.Windows.Input.MouseEventArgs.MouseDevice%2A> is useful particularly because you can check <xref:System.Windows.Input.MouseDevice.Captured%2A> on it.       Note that events that specifically deal with mouse button events use a different delegate, <xref:System.Windows.Input.MouseButtonEventHandler>. The mouse button properties are available on <xref:System.Windows.Input.MouseEventArgs> in case there are input modes or interactions that involve the buttons even if you are handling a non-button event."
