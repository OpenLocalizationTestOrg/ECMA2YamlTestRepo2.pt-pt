  summary: "Manages a collection of <see cref=&quot;T:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignSurface&quot;></see> objects."
  remarks: "The DesignSurfaceManager class is designed to be a container of <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignSurface> objects. It provides common services that handle event routing between designers, property windows, and other global objects. Using DesignSurfaceManager is optional, but it is recommended if you intend to have several designer windows.       The DesignSurfaceManager class provides several design-time services automatically. You can override each of these services by replacing them in the protected <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignSurfaceManager.ServiceContainer%2A> property. To replace a service, override the constructor, call base, and make any changes through the protected <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignSurfaceManager.ServiceContainer%2A> property. All services added to the service container that implement the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface are disposed when the design surface manager is disposed. The DesignSurfaceManager class provides the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.IDesignerEventService> interface as the default service. <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.IDesignerEventService> provides a global eventing mechanism for designer events. With this mechanism, an application is informed when a designer becomes active. The service provides a collection of designers and a single place where global objects, such as the Properties window, can monitor selection change events."
