  summary: "Gets or sets a value that indicates the present state of the event handling for a routed event as it travels the route."
  remarks: "Marking the event handled will limit the visibility of the routed event to listeners along the event route. The event does still travel the remainder of the route, but only handlers specifically added with `HandledEventsToo` `true` in the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AddHandler%28System.Windows.RoutedEvent%2CSystem.Delegate%2CSystem.Boolean%29> method call will be invoked in response. Default handlers on instance listeners (such as those expressed in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]) will not be invoked. Handling events that are marked handled is not a common scenario.       If you are a control author defining your own events, the decisions you make regarding event handling at the class level will impact users of your control as well as any users of derived controls, and potentially other elements that are either contained by your control or that contain your control. For more information, see [Marking Routed Events as Handled, and Class Handling](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).       In very rare circumstances it is appropriate to handle events where  Handled is marked `true`, and modify the event arguments by changing Handled to `false`. This can be necessary in certain areas of input events of controls, such as key handling of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.KeyDown> versus <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TextInput> where low level and high level input events compete for the handling, and each is attempting to work with a different routing strategy."

Invocations can be made more efficient by not relying on reflection. This is the scenario that motivates this method being available for any routed event arguments class that choose to override it.

The original source information is read-only to class handlers or class implementations, just as it is reported in the event data.       Common cases where the source may be adjusted include content elements inside a content model for a control (the contents of a list item, for instance, will report the list item element as the <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.Source%2A> and the actual element within the list item will be the OriginalSource.       Source adjustment by various elements and content models varies from class to class. Each class that adjusts event sources attempts to anticipate which source is the most useful to report for most input scenarios and the scenarios for which the class is intended, and then sets that source as the <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.Source%2A>. If this source is not the one that has relevance to your handling of the event, try checking OriginalSource instead to see if it reports a different source that is more suitable.

Which of the two elements involved in the event is of the most importance in any given handler (Source, the element that raised it, or `sender`, the element that is currently handling it) is dependent on the application logic that your handler is addressing.       Setting this property is typically only done when overriding or implementing other [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_api#plural](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] that adjust event sources, such as when class handling an event. Resetting apparent event sources from instance handlers is not recommended, particularly when the handler does not mark the event as handled.       If you do reset Source to report a different event source, <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.OriginalSource%2A> will continue to report the source as first raised by the originating <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.RaiseEvent%2A> call."
