  summary: "Contains constants for controlling the kind of access other <see cref=&quot;T:System.IO.FileStream&quot;></see> objects can have to the same file."
  remarks: "For an example of creating a file and writing text to a file, see [How to: Write Text to a File](../Topic/How%20to:%20Write%20Text%20to%20a%20File.md). For an example of reading text from a file, see [How to: Read Text from a File](../Topic/How%20to:%20Read%20Text%20from%20a%20File.md). For an example of reading from and writing to a binary file, see [How to: Read and Write to a Newly Created Data File](../Topic/How%20to:%20Read%20and%20Write%20to%20a%20Newly%20Created%20Data%20File.md).       A typical use of this enumeration is to define whether two processes can simultaneously read from the same file. For example, if a file is opened and Read is specified, other users can open the file for reading but not for writing.       A FileShare parameter is specified in some of the constructors for <xref:System.IO.FileStream>, <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFileStream>, and in some of the `Open` methods of <xref:System.IO.File> and <xref:System.IO.FileInfo> to control how a file is opened."
  example:
  - "The following <xref:System.IO.FileStream> constructor opens an existing file and grants read-only access to other users (Read).  \n  \n [!code-vb[Classic FileAccess Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.io.fileshare_1.vb)]\n [!code-cpp[Classic FileAccess Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/CPP/t-system.io.fileshare_1.cpp)]\n [!code-cs[Classic FileAccess Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.io.fileshare_1.cs)]"
