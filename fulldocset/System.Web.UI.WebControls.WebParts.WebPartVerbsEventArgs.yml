  summary: "Provides event data for the <xref href=&quot;System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.CreateVerbs&quot;></xref> event that is used by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.OnCreateVerbs*> method."
  remarks: "The WebPartVerbsEventArgs class represents the event data for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.CreateVerbs> event, which occurs when the Web Parts verbs are created for a zone that derives from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> class.       Web Parts verbs represent actions that users can perform in the user interface (UI) of a Web Parts page, such as minimizing, closing, or restoring controls; adding controls to a page; or canceling an action. Verbs can appear in both the header and footer areas of a zone, and there are both standard verbs provided with the Web Parts control set, and custom verbs that can be added by developers. A verb is represented in the UI by a clickable object, which you can set to appear as a hyperlink, an image, or a button, by using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.VerbButtonType%2A> property.       A <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> zone provides a standard set of verbs that get rendered in a Web Parts control&quot;s verbs menu. A custom Web Parts zone, or a Web Parts control inside a Web Parts zone, can add additional verbs to the menu.       A control in a Web Parts zone can add verbs to the control&quot;s verbs menu by inheriting from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> base class and overriding the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Verbs%2A> property. If the control does not inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> base class, you can add a new verb by implementing the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebActionable> interface, and then overriding the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebActionable.Verbs%2A> collection.       The protected <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.OnCreateVerbs%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method allows derived classes to override the event without attaching a delegate to it. A derived class must always call the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.OnCreateVerbs%2A> method of the base class to ensure that registered delegates receive the event."
