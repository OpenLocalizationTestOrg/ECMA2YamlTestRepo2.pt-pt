  summary: "Represents an association between a source <see cref=&quot;T:System.IO.Packaging.Package&quot;></see> or <see cref=&quot;T:System.IO.Packaging.PackagePart&quot;></see>, and a target object which can be a <see cref=&quot;T:System.IO.Packaging.PackagePart&quot;></see> or external resource."
  remarks: "A PackageRelationship defines an association between a *source* <xref:System.IO.Packaging.Package> or <xref:System.IO.Packaging.PackagePart> to a *target* <xref:System.IO.Packaging.PackagePart> or external resource.  The source object is considered the &quot;owner&quot; of the relationship.       The PackageRelationship class has no public constructor; instead, two Create methods are used:      |||   |-|-|   |<xref:System.IO.Packaging.Package>.<xref:System.IO.Packaging.Package.CreateRelationship%2A>|Creates a &quot;package-level&quot; relationship—from a package to a specified part or external resource.|   |<xref:System.IO.Packaging.PackagePart>.<xref:System.IO.Packaging.PackagePart.CreateRelationship%2A>|Creates a &quot;part-level&quot; relationship—from one part to another part or external resource.|       The source package or part is identified by the <xref:System.IO.Packaging.PackageRelationship.SourceUri%2A> property of the relationship.  The target part or external resource is identified by the <xref:System.IO.Packaging.PackageRelationship.TargetUri%2A> property of the relationship.       Creating or deleting a relationship does not affect the source or target objects in any way.       If a source object is deleted, all relationships owned by the object are also deleted.       Relationships enable navigation both in a document and between documents.  Relationships also support document object model services, such as linking a <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> to specific document elements when printing.       For more information about PackageRelationship elements see Section 1.3 &quot;Relationships&quot; in the *Open Packaging Conventions* specification available for download at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=71255](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=71255)."
