  summary: "Specifies whether a printer uses one-sided printing or some type of two-sided (duplex) printing."
  remarks: "Use the values of this type primarily for these purposes:      -   As members of the <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities.DuplexingCapability%2A> collection, which is a property of <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities>, these values indicate the kinds of one-sided and two-sided printing that the printer supports.      -   As the value of the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket.Duplexing%2A> property of a <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket>, they direct the printer to use one-sided printing or some kind of two-sided printing.       The **Unknown** value is never used in properties of <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities> objects.       You should never set a <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> property to **Unknown**. If some other <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> producing application has created a *PrintTicket document* that sets the duplexing feature to an unrecognized duplexing option (that is, an option that is not defined in the [Print Schema](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186397)), then a <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> object in your application that is constructed with that document will have **Unknown** as the value of the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket.Duplexing%2A> property.       Although the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> and <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities> classes cannot be inherited, you can extend the [Print Schema](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186397) to recognize print device features that are not accounted for in the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> or <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities> classes. For more information see [NOTINBUILD: How to: Extend the Print Schema and Create New Print System Classes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/a3600218-1ea5-478a-9853-6560464f2885)."
