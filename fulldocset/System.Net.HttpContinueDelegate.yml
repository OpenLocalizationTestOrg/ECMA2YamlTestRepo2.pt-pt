  summary: "Represents the method that notifies callers when a continue response is received by the client."
  remarks: "Use HttpContinueDelegate to specify the callback method to be called when an HTTP 100-continue response is received from the server. When set, the delegate is called whenever the first protocol response of type <xref:System.Net.HttpStatusCode?displayProperty=fullName> is received. This is a change from the behavior of the version 1.1 Framework.       Your event handler must declare the same parameters as the HttpContinueDelegate.      > [!NOTE] >  `StatusCode` is always <xref:System.Net.HttpStatusCode?displayProperty=fullName>.       This is useful when the client wants to display the status of data being received from the server."
