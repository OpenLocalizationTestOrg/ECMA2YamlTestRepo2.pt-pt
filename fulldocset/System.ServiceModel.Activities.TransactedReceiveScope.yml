  summary: "An activity which scopes the lifetime of a transaction which is initiated by a received message. The transaction may be flowed into the workflow on the initiating message, or be created by the dispatcher when the message is received."
  remarks: "The TransactedReceiveScope activity enables you to control the lifetime of the flowed transaction.      > [!WARNING] >  For an initiating TransactedReceiveScope activity (a TransactedReceiveScope that contains a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity with <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive.CanCreateInstance%2A> set to `true`), the transaction is created before the runtime starts to execute the TransactedReceiveScope activity. This transaction is not ambient at the workflow activity layer, but it is ambient in the underlying persistence layers. If execution of the workflow encounters a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Persist> activity before the TransactedReceiveScope activity, the runtime tries to persist under the ambient transaction. This behavior causes a block until the transaction is completed. Because the workflow execution has not reached the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope.Body%2A> section, the transaction cannot finish. This deadlock causes the workflow to stop responding until the transaction times out. When the transaction times out, the newly created instance is aborted.      > [!IMPORTANT] >  Whenever you use a TransactedReceiveScope it is recommended to place all Receives in the workflow within TransactedReceiveScope activities.      > [!IMPORTANT] >  When using TransactedReceiveScope and messages arrive in the incorrect order, the workflow will be aborted when trying to deliver the first out of order message. You must make sure your workflow is always at a consistent stopping point when the workflow idles. This will allow you to restart the workflow from a previous persistence point should the workflow be aborted."
