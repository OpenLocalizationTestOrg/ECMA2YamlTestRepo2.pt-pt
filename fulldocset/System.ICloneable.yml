  summary: "Supports cloning, which creates a new instance of a class with the same value as an existing instance."
  remarks: "The ICloneable interface enables you to provide a customized implementation that creates a copy of an existing object. The ICloneable interface contains one member, the <xref:System.ICloneable.Clone%2A> method, which is intended to provide cloning support beyond that supplied by <xref:System.Object.MemberwiseClone%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.  For more information about cloning, deep versus shallow copies, and examples, see the <xref:System.Object.MemberwiseClone%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method."

  summary: "Creates a new object that is a copy of the current instance."
  remarks: "The resulting clone must be of the same type as, or compatible with, the original instance.       An implementation of Clone can perform either a deep copy or a shallow copy. In a deep copy, all objects are duplicated; in a shallow copy, only the top-level objects are duplicated and the lower levels contain references. Because callers of Clone cannot depend on the method performing a predictable cloning operation, we recommend that <xref:System.ICloneable> not be implemented in public APIs.       See <xref:System.Object.MemberwiseClone%2A?displayProperty=fullName> for more information on cloning, deep versus shallow copies, and examples."
