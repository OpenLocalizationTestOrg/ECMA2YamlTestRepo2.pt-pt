  summary: "Indicates that the modified instance of a variable differs from its true type when marshaling. This class cannot be inherited."
  remarks: "The CompilerMarshalOverride class allows the common language runtime to marshal using the correct sizes.       Some behaviors of the common language runtime are incompatible with some languages. For example, C++ treats Boolean variables as single-byte values, while the common language runtime marshals them as four-byte values to match the `BOOLEAN` type defined by the Microsoft Win32 API.  To work around such issues, the C++ compiler emits this modifier on any `wchar_t` or `bool` parameter or function return."
