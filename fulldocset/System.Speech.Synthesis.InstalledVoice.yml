  summary: "Contains information about a speech synthesis voice installed in Windows."
  remarks: "Use this class to get information about an installed voice, including its culture, name, gender, age, and whether it is enabled.       To perform text-to-speech using the language specified in the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.PromptBuilder.Culture%2A> property, a speech synthesis engine that supports that language-country code must be installed. The speech synthesis engines that shipped with Microsoft Windows 7 work with the following language-country codes:      -   en-US. English (United States)      -   zh-CN. Chinese (China)      -   zh-TW. Chinese (Taiwan)       Two-letter language codes such as &quot;en&quot; are also permitted."
