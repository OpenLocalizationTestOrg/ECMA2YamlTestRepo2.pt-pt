  remarks: "> [!NOTE] >  [!INCLUDE[DeprecatedContent](~/add/includes/deprecatedcontent-md.md)]       A workflow instance may be suspended in one of three ways: the host may call <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowInstance.Suspend%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, a <xref:System.Workflow.ComponentModel.SuspendActivity> activity may be invoked from inside the workflow instance, or the workflow runtime engine may suspend the workflow instance. When the workflow instance is suspended, the workflow runtime engine raises the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowRuntime.WorkflowSuspended?displayProperty=fullName> event. The host may subscribe to this event by adding an event handler to <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowRuntime.WorkflowSuspended?displayProperty=fullName>."
