  summary: "Establishes a design-time service that manages the collection of <see cref=&quot;T:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionItem&quot;></see> objects for components."
  remarks: "The DesignerActionService class is responsible for managing the collection of <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionItem> objects for each instance of a component that exists on a form at design time. This class enables a direct push model of item creation, and is primarily intended for use by design-time tool developers, although it can also be used by component and custom control developers.       Design-time tool developers will need to determine the list of items to display for a component and determine when this list changes. They may also create add-ins that operate in conjunction with smart tag panel objects.       Advanced component developers may need to dynamically control the items associated with a component, thus replacing or supplementing the standard pull model. For example, panel commands can be altered depending on the context of their use and the design-time state of the component.      > [!NOTE] >  The DesignerActionService is actually the driving service behind both the push and pull models; however, in the latter case it operates implicitly.       DesignerActionService provides a straightforward interface for accessing and manipulating the items for each component, including the following methods and events:      -   The <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionService.Contains%2A> method determines whether the DesignerActionService is currently managing a particular component.      -   The <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionService.GetComponentActions%2A> method supports the enumeration of the lists of items.      -   The <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionService.Add%2A> method allows adding a <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionList> or <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionListCollection> to the set of existing items for a component instance. In contrast, the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionService.Remove%2A> method removes one or all of the item lists associated with a component.          > [!NOTE]     >  The <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionService.Add%2A> method represents the direct push model of associating panel items with a component. In contrast, the pull model relies on overriding the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.ComponentDesigner.ActionLists%2A> property of the designer class for that component. The design environment is responsible for adding these items into the current DesignerActionService when a component is created on the design surface.          > [!IMPORTANT]     >  The <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionService.Add%2A>, <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionService.Remove%2A>, <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionService.Contains%2A>, and <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionService.Clear%2A> methods only consider or affect push-model items.      -   The <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionService.DesignerActionListsChanged> event indicates when the collection of items changes for a component.       Because it is often desirable to use some of the same panel items in both the component&quot;s design-time shortcut menu and its panel, a large degree of interoperability exists between <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionItem> objects and designer verbs.       If a component designer does not explicitly specify a <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionList> (that is, it does not contain an overridden <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.ComponentDesigner.ActionLists%2A> property), then a list will be created from existing designer verbs. These verbs are specified by the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.ComponentDesigner.Verbs%2A> property. In this case, an internal verb list class is used to contain the collection of verb item panel entries.       If you want a <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionMethodItem> to be used both as a panel entry and a design-time shortcut menu entry, then you can set the `includeAsDesignerVerb` parameter in the item&quot;s constructor.       Use the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionUIService> to control the display of your designer&quot;s <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.ComponentDesigner.ActionLists%2A>."
