  summary: "Provides an explicit layout that is visible from unmanaged code and that will have the same layout as the Win32 OVERLAPPED structure with additional reserved fields at the end."
  remarks: "The NativeOverlapped.NET Framework value type represents an unmanaged version of the Win32 OVERLAPPED structure. The layout of this structure must be identical to OVERLAPPED. Four additional DWORDs are reserved at the end."
