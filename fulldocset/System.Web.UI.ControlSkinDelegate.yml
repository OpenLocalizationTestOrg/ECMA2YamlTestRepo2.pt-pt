  summary: "Represents the method that applies the correct control skin to the specified control."
  remarks: "Page and control developers do not use the ControlSkinDelegate, <xref:System.Web.UI.ControlSkin>, or <xref:System.Web.UI.PageTheme> classes directly. These classes are used internally by the ASP.NET page framework to apply server- side properties and cascading style sheet definitions that are defined in ASP.NET themes and control skin files to specific types of controls.       The ControlSkinDelegate delegate is associated with the <xref:System.Web.UI.ControlSkin.ApplySkin%2A> method of the <xref:System.Web.UI.ControlSkin> class. The <xref:System.Web.UI.ControlSkin> class represents an ASP.NET control skin, which is a component of an ASP.NET theme represented by a <xref:System.Web.UI.PageTheme> object. For more information about ASP.NET themes, see [ASP.NET Themes and Skins](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)."
