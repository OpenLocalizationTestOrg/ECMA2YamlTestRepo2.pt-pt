  summary: "Creates an object graph from a source XAML node stream."
  remarks: "The `Write` methods of XamlObjectWriter implement a pattern so that the XamlObjectWriter uses the <xref:System.Xaml.XamlWriter> that is defined by the <xref:System.Xaml.XamlWriter.WriteNode%2A> method. <xref:System.Xaml.XamlWriter.WriteNode%2A> logic switches between the `Write` methods, depending on which node type is at the current position in the reader.      ## Scope    A XamlObjectWriter has a concept of scope; that is, the XamlObjectWriter maintains a conceptual point of reference in its output object graph. For a particular scope, certain operations might be valid or invalid, or produce a no-operation result. For example, if you call <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriter.WriteStartMember%2A> to write directives for initialization on an object that already exists as an instance, the default implementation throws an exception.       A possible technique for tracking scope in a custom XamlObjectWriter is to align the node actions with a stack or frame class. The stack or frame can keep track of push and pop for each level of object-model depth that is entered or exited while the XamlObjectWriter writes the object graph.      ## Callbacks    To support intermediate and advanced XamlObjectWriter scenarios, the mechanism of writing an object graph provides callback entry points that occur when a XamlObjectWriter commits or is about to commit certain actions. Some callbacks are enabled in the settings and are not specific to the object type or the member being written; however, callback information is often available in context or is in the event data that is sent through the callback. The following is a list of relevant callbacks:      -   The callback that is declared by <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriterSettings.AfterBeginInitHandler%2A> is invoked when the scope goes to a new object and at the <xref:System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize.BeginInit%2A> phase of object lifetime for each created object.      -   The callback that is declared by <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriterSettings.AfterEndInitHandler%2A> is invoked when the scope goes to a new object and at the <xref:System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize.EndInit%2A> phase of object lifetime for each created object.      -   The callback that is declared by <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriterSettings.BeforePropertiesHandler%2A> is invoked when the scope starts in an object, and occurs when the first <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriter.WriteStartMember%2A> call to that object scope is made but not yet committed.      -   The callback that is declared by <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriterSettings.AfterPropertiesHandler%2A> is invoked when the scope starts in an object, and happens when the <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriter.WriteEndObject%2A> call to that object scope is made but not yet committed.      -   The callback that is declared by <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriterSettings.XamlSetValueHandler%2A> is invoked when <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriter.OnSetValue%2A> is called.      ## Writing Dictionary Keys    The default implementation of XamlObjectWriter supports type conversion on the constraints of a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary%602> before the dictionary contents are added to the object graph. In this manner, a generic dictionary can be keyed at run time by objects and can match the relevant generic `Add` and indexer behavior. However, as implemented for the base XamlObjectWriter, this capability exists only for object graph creation from the base <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary%602> class and not for derived classes of <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary%602>.      ## Checks for Disposed    XAML writers are potentially used for deferred operations or where a call is made against a XAML writer instance that has been disposed in the interim. Various APIs of XamlObjectWriter might throw <xref:System.ObjectDisposedException> in these cases."

  summary: "Writes the conceptual <xref uid=&quot;langword_csharp_StartObject&quot; name=&quot;StartObject&quot; href=&quot;&quot;></xref> into the object graph when the specified object is a default or implicit value of the parent property. The implicit value comes from information that is obtained from the XAML schema context and backing type information, instead of being specified as an object value in the input XAML node set."
  remarks: "The difference between writing with WriteGetObject and writing with <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriter.WriteStartObject%2A> can be seen in the resulting object graph. WriteGetObject does not construct an instance of a type because the WriteGetObject API has no information to inform the object graph of what to construct. Instead, the object was created when the parent property was initialized; so a <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriter> does not need to construct it. In contrast, <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriter.WriteStartObject%2A> specifies that an instance of that type should be constructed and inserted into the object graph.       If you think of the XAML node stream as a series of frames, a WriteGetObject is balanced to a <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriter.WriteEndObject%2A> call. Therefore, the number of WriteGetObject plus <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriter.WriteStartObject%2A> calls should equal the number of <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriter.WriteEndObject%2A> calls as part of a complete object-writing evaluation of the XAML node stream.       The conceptual `StartObject` position for an implicit object in the object graph is necessary because although the object value itself is an implicit default, that object might still have members that need to be written based on the XAML node stream. A typical scenario where this occurs is when <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriter> writes member nodes for a collection property, and the collection initialization is implicit to creating the object that owns the collection property."

  summary: "Defines a namespace declaration that applies to the next object scope or member scope."
  remarks: "A namespace declaration can be written if the current scope is a root scope, object scope, or member scope. However, WriteNamespace can only be called immediately before a call to one of the following: WriteNamespace, <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriter.WriteStartObject%2A>, or <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriter.WriteStartMember%2A>. The consecutive WriteNamespace case is for writing multiple namespace declarations to the same node. Eventually, either <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriter.WriteStartObject%2A> or <xref:System.Xaml.XamlObjectWriter.WriteStartMember%2A> must be called.       WriteNamespace does not use a `Start`/`End` metaphor. Although a XAML namespace has members in the CLR representation sense, the members are known and do not need to be represented as a special type of <xref:System.Xaml.XamlMember> for extensibility. To access the values of a <xref:System.Xaml.NamespaceDeclaration>, you access its <xref:System.Xaml.NamespaceDeclaration.Namespace%2A> and <xref:System.Xaml.NamespaceDeclaration.Prefix%2A> properties.       A namespace declaration may have a <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName> value for the prefix. A <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName> prefix represents a declaration of the default XAML namespace. Do not attempt to use null to represent the default prefix;  it throws an exception in this API. For more information, see <xref:System.Xaml.NamespaceDeclaration>."

    > [!TIP]

    >  Watch for a <xref:System.Xaml.XamlDuplicateMemberException>, which occurs when the same XAML property is set twice in the XAML input. In simple cases, such as when the same property is set in both attribute syntax and property element syntax, you can easily see this exception in the input markup. However, more subtle cases can occur that are more difficult to spot. For example, this exception might occur if you set a XAML content property, if you involve XAML ambient properties, and if a property enables both an attachable usage and an instance usage. In the debugging phases of development, you can often locate this exception by viewing the intermediate XAML node representation that connects the markup read and the object graph write.
