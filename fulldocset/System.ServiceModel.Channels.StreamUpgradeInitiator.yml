  summary: "To implement a custom upgrade initiator, inherit from this <xref uid=&quot;langword_csharp_abstract&quot; name=&quot;abstract&quot; href=&quot;&quot;></xref> base class."
  remarks: "An example of a stream upgrade is to build a compression stream directly on top of the transport stream. This class is used with <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.StreamUpgradeAcceptor> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.StreamUpgradeProvider> to implement a custom stream upgrade.       For a detailed description of the upgrade process, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.StreamUpgradeProvider>."
