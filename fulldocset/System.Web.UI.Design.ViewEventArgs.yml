  summary: "Provides data for the <xref href=&quot;System.Web.UI.Design.IControlDesignerView.ViewEvent&quot;></xref> event."
  remarks: "The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.IControlDesignerView.ViewEvent> event is raised by the designer host for certain actions on a control on the design surface. The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.IControlDesignerView.ViewEvent> is handled by a <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventHandler> delegate method, which takes a ViewEventArgs object as a parameter.       The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ControlDesigner> class supplies a default delegate to handle the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.IControlDesignerView.ViewEvent>. Custom control designers override the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ControlDesigner.OnClick%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ControlDesigner.OnPaint%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.TemplatedControlDesigner.OnTemplateModeChanged%2A> methods to process those events for the control on the design surface.       The designer host initializes a ViewEventArgs object for the type of action on the design surface, and then passes the object to the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventHandler> delegate. The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventArgs.Region%2A> property represents the control designer region that the event applies to. The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventArgs.EventType%2A> property of the ViewEventArgs object indicates which type of action:      -   A <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEvent.Click> event.      -   A <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEvent.Paint> event.      -   A <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEvent.TemplateModeChanged> event.       The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventArgs.EventArgs%2A> property supplies the event arguments that are specific to the type of action.       For example, the designer host initializes ViewEventArgs objects as follows:      -   A <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.DesignerRegionMouseEventArgs> object when you click a region.      -   A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> object when a control is drawn on the design surface.      -   A <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.TemplateModeChangedEventArgs> object when the template editing mode changes for the control on the design surface.       For more information about events and delegates, see [NIB: Events and Delegates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d98fd58b-fa4f-4598-8378-addf4355a115)."
