  summary: "Provides a base class for a service that will exist as part of a service application. ServiceBase must be derived from when creating a new service class."
  remarks: "Derive from ServiceBase when defining your service class in a service application. Any useful service overrides the [OnStart(String\\[\\])](assetId:///M:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart(System.String[])?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True) and <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStop%2A> methods. For additional functionality, you can override <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnPause%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnContinue%2A> with specific behavior in response to changes in the service state.  \n  \n A service is a long-running executable that does not support a user interface, and which might not run under the logged-on user account. The service can run without any user being logged on to the computer.  \n  \n By default, services run under the System account, which is not the same as the Administrator account. You cannot change the rights of the System account. Alternatively, you can use a <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller> to specify a user account under which the service will run.  \n  \n An executable can contain more than one service but must contain a separate <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller> for each service. The <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller> instance registers the service with the system. The installer also associates each service with an event log that you can use to record service commands. The `main()` function in the executable defines which services should run. The current working directory of the service is the system directory, not the directory in which the executable is located.  \n  \n When you start a service, the system locates the executable and runs the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method for that service, contained within the executable. However, running the service is not the same as running the executable. The executable only loads the service. The service is accessed (for example, started and stopped) through the Service Control Manager.  \n  \n The executable calls the ServiceBase derived class's constructor the first time you call Start on the service. The <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> command-handling method is called immediately after the constructor executes. The constructor is not executed again after the first time the service has been loaded, so it is necessary to separate the processing performed by the constructor from that performed by <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A>. Any resources that can be released by <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStop%2A> should be created in <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A>. Creating resources in the constructor prevents them from being created properly if the service is started again after <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStop%2A> has released the resources.  \n  \n The Service Control Manager (SCM) provides a way to interact with the service. You can use the SCM to pass Start, Stop, Pause, Continue, or custom commands into the service. The SCM uses the values of <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanStop%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanPauseAndContinue%2A> to determine whether the service accepts Stop, Pause, or Continue commands. Stop, Pause, and Continue are enabled in the SCM's context menus only if the corresponding property <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanStop%2A> or <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanPauseAndContinue%2A> is `true` in the service class. If enabled, the command is passed to the service, and <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStop%2A>, <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnPause%2A>, or <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnContinue%2A> is called. If <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanStop%2A>, <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanShutdown%2A>, or <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanPauseAndContinue%2A> is `false`, the corresponding command-handling method (such as <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStop%2A>) will not be processed, even if you have implemented the method.  \n  \n You can use the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController> class to do programmatically what the SCM does using a user interface. You can automate the tasks available in the console. If <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanStop%2A>, <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanShutdown%2A>, or <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanPauseAndContinue%2A> is `true` but you have not implemented a corresponding command-handling method (such as <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStop%2A>) the system throws an exception and ignores the command.  \n  \n You do not have to implement <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A>, <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStop%2A>, or any other method in ServiceBase. However, the service's behavior is described in <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A>, so at minimum, this member should be overridden. The `main()` function of the executable registers the service in the executable with the Service Control Manager by calling the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.Run%2A> method. The <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.ServiceName%2A> property of the ServiceBase object passed to the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.Run%2A> method must match the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.ServiceName%2A> property of the service installer for that service.  \n  \n You can use `InstallUtil.exe` to install services on your system.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You can specify a log other than the Application event log to receive notification of service calls, but neither the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.AutoLog%2A> nor the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.EventLog%2A> property can write to a custom log. Set <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.AutoLog%2A> to `false` if you do not want to use automatic logging."

  summary: "Creates a new instance of the <see cref=&quot;T:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase&quot;></see> class."
  remarks: "Do not create an instance of the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase> class. Instead, derive from <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase> and instantiate your derived class. The minimum you need to implement in the constructor for a class inherited from <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase> is to set the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.ServiceName%2A> on your component. No other processing is specifically required in the constructor. You should handle most initialization in <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> rather than in the constructor. Otherwise, there is no guarantee the objects will be reinitialized when you restart a service after it has been stopped.       If you override the constructor in your derived class, call the base class constructor in your code.       The <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase> constructor sets <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.AutoLog%2A> to `true`. If you do not want to automatically log calls to the service from the Service Control Manager (SCM), set <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.AutoLog%2A> to `false`.       If the executable contains a single service, the system calls the service&quot;s constructor when Start is selected from the SCM, and runs the destructor if Stop is called.       If the executable contains multiple services, calling Start on one service causes the constructors to be called for all services in the executable, but only the specified service is started. Destructors for the services are run together when all services have been stopped, not individually when each service is stopped.      > [!NOTE] >  If you override the base class constructor, you should explicitly call it in the constructor of your derived class."

OnPause is expected to be overridden when the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanPauseAndContinue%2A> property is `true`.       When you continue a paused service (either through the Services console or programmatically), the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnContinue%2A> processing is run, and the service becomes active again.       The Pause command only allows your application to react to a specific event. OnPause does nothing to the service that you do not define it to do.       Sending a Pause request to the service can conserve system resources because Pause need not release all system resources. For example, if threads have been opened by the process, pausing a service rather than stopping it can allow the threads to remain open, obviating the need to reallocate them when the service continues. If you define Pause to release all system resources, it behaves like a Stop command.       Set <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.CanPauseAndContinue%2A> to `true`, and override OnPause and <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnContinue%2A> to specify the processing that should occur when the SCM passes a Pause or Continue request to your service. <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnContinue%2A> should be implemented to undo the processing in OnPause.
