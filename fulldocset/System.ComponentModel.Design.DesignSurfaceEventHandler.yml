  summary: "Represents the method that will handle the <see cref=&quot;E:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignSurfaceManager.DesignSurfaceCreated&quot;></see> event of a <see cref=&quot;T:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignSurfaceManager&quot;></see> class. This class cannot be inherited."
  remarks: 'When you create a DesignSurfaceEventHandler delegate, you identify a method to handle the event. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The event handler is called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the delegate. For more information about event handler delegates, see [NIB: Events and Delegates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d98fd58b-fa4f-4598-8378-addf4355a115).'
