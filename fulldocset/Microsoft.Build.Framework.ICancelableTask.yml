  summary: "Instructs the task to exit as soon as possible, or to immediately exit if Execute is invoked after this method."
  remarks: "Cancel() may be called at any time after the task has been instantiated, even before <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITask.Execute%2A> is called.       Cancel calls may come in from any thread. The implementation of this method should not block indefinitely.       To cancel the build, both `Cancel` and `Execute` must return in any order."
