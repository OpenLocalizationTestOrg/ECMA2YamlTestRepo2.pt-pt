  summary: "Provides data for the <see cref=&quot;E:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.DrawNode&quot;></see> event."
  remarks: "Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.DrawNode> event to customize the appearance of nodes in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control using owner drawing.       The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.DrawNode> event is raised by a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control when its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.DrawMode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewDrawMode?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewDrawMode?displayProperty=fullName> and a node is displayed or updated. The DrawTreeNodeEventArgs passed to the event handler contains information about the node to draw as well as providing methods to help you draw the node.       Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DrawTreeNodeEventArgs.State%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DrawTreeNodeEventArgs.Node%2A> properties to retrieve information about the node to draw. Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DrawTreeNodeEventArgs.Graphics%2A> property to do the actual drawing within the area specified by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DrawTreeNodeEventArgs.Bounds%2A> property. To make the operating system draw a node that does not need to be owner drawn, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DrawTreeNodeEventArgs.DrawDefault%2A> property to `true`.       When the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.DrawMode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewDrawMode?displayProperty=fullName>, the area indicated by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DrawTreeNodeEventArgs.Bounds%2A> property includes the label portion of the node only. When the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.DrawMode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewDrawMode?displayProperty=fullName>, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DrawTreeNodeEventArgs.Bounds%2A> area includes the entire node, including the area typically used for icons, checkboxes, plus and minus signs, and lines connecting the nodes."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates how to customize a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control using owner drawing. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control in the example displays optional node tags alongside the standard node labels. Node tags are specified using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode.Tag%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control also uses custom colors, including a custom highlight color.  \n  \n You can customize most of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> colors by setting color properties, but the selection highlight color is not available as a property. Additionally, the default selection highlight rectangle extends only around a node label. Owner drawing must be used to draw the node tags and to draw a customized highlight rectangle large enough to include a node tag.  \n  \n In the example, a handler for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.DrawNode?displayProperty=fullName> event draws the node tags and the custom selection highlight manually. Unselected nodes do not need customization. For these, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DrawTreeNodeEventArgs.DrawDefault%2A> property is set to `true` so that they will be drawn by the operating system.  \n  \n Additionally, a handler for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> event provides hit-testing. By default, a node can be selected only by clicking the region around its label. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> event handler selects a node that is clicked anywhere within this region or within the region around a node tag, if present.  \n  \n [!code-vb[TreeViewOwnerDraw#1](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.windows.forms.d_20_1.vb)]\n [!code-cpp[TreeViewOwnerDraw#1](~/add/codesnippet/CPP/t-system.windows.forms.d_20_1.cpp)]\n [!code-cs[TreeViewOwnerDraw#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.windows.forms.d_20_1.cs)]"
