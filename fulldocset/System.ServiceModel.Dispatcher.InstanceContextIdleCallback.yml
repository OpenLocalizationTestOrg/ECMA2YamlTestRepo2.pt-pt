  summary: "Represents the method that is called when an &lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.InstanceContext?displayProperty=fullName&gt; object has finished processing."
  remarks: "Use an InstanceContextIdleCallback to notify the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] runtime that an InstanceContextIdleCallback object has finished processing. When the InstanceContextIdleCallback object notifies the runtime that the InstanceContextIdleCallback has finished its work, [!INCLUDE[indigo2](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] calls <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.IInstanceContextProvider.IsIdle%2A?displayProperty=fullName> once again. This cycle continues until <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.IInstanceContextProvider.IsIdle%2A?displayProperty=fullName> returns `true` and the context is closed and recycled.       For more information, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.IInstanceContextProvider.NotifyIdle%2A>."
