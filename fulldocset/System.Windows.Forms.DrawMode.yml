  summary: "Specifies how the elements of a control are drawn."
  remarks: "This enumeration is used by members such as <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox.DrawMode%2A> in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckedListBox>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox> classes.       You can override the drawing of some controls or certain elements. This enumeration is used to specify if a control is drawn by the operating system or if your own code handles the drawing of the control.      > [!NOTE] >  The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckedListBox> class only supports Normal; owner draw modes are ignored.       For more information about using the DrawMode enumeration, see the `MeasureItem` and `DrawItem` events, and the `ItemHeight` property."
  example:
  - "The following example demonstrates how to create owner-drawn <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox> items. The code uses the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox.DrawMode%2A> property to specify that the items drawn are fixed sized and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox.DrawItem> event to perform the drawing of each item into the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox>. The example code uses the properties and methods of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DrawItemEventArgs> class passed as a parameter to the event handler to draw the items. This example assumes that a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox> control called `listBox1` has been added to a form and that the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox.DrawItem> event is handled by the event handler defined in the example code. The example also assumes that items have been added to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox> with the text of \"Apple\", \"Orange\", and \"Plum\" in that order.  \n  \n [!code-vb[ListBox.DrawMode#1](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.windows.forms.d_81_1.vb)]\n [!code-cs[ListBox.DrawMode#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.windows.forms.d_81_1.cs)]"
