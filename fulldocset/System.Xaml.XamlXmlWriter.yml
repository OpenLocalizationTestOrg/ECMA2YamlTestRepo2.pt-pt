  summary: "Uses a <xref:System.IO.TextWriter> or <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> support class to write a XAML node stream to a text or markup serialized form."
  remarks: "This class is typically used in serialization scenarios.      ## How to Use XamlXmlWriter    The <xref:System.Xaml.XamlWriter> API has several methods that write different types of XAML nodes. Collectively, these are referred to in documentation as the `Write` methods of a <xref:System.Xaml.XamlWriter>. XamlXmlWriter uses several internal state classes to determine what to do when one of its `Write` implementations is called. A `Write` call uses the states to determine whether the requested element, attribute, or value can be written, or whether an exception is thrown. For example, if you call <xref:System.Xaml.XamlXmlWriter.WriteEndObject%2A> and the state of the XamlXmlWriter current node position is on a value or within a member, an exception is thrown. Typically, callers of the XamlXmlWriter API should be aware of the type of the current XAML node that is coming from the XAML reader and the XAML node stream. Based on this knowledge, callers should avoid calling `Write` APIs that are not relevant to the current node type.      ## XAML Namespaces and XamlXmlWriter    The XAML namespace writing behavior of XamlXmlWriter is complex and is not limited to explicit calls to <xref:System.Xaml.XamlXmlWriter.WriteNamespace%2A>. Instead, other `Write` calls, such as <xref:System.Xaml.XamlXmlWriter.WriteStartObject%2A>, might require that the namespace declaration be written at particular points in the node structure. The XAML writer either generates a prefix by its own logic, or uses information from the <xref:System.Xaml.INamespacePrefixLookup> service to determine a preferred prefix. Also, explicit <xref:System.Xaml.XamlXmlWriter.WriteNamespace%2A> calls might defer or might return nothing if the XAML namespace declaration is already applicable and declared elsewhere.      ## Write Method Exceptions    Exceptions thrown by the XamlXmlWriter`Write` methods are typically either <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> or <xref:System.Xaml.XamlXmlWriterException>.       An <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> often indicates that a XAML reader passed an invalid node structure into the XAML node stream. In this case the node structure is invalid for reasons that are not related to validation of a XAML schema or a XAML schema context. Rather, the node stream is invalid in its basic form. For example, if a faulty XAML reader implementation generated a XAML node stream that contained two consecutive `StartObject` nodes, the attempt to call the second <xref:System.Xaml.XamlXmlWriter.WriteStartObject%2A> would throw an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException>. All XAML writers would consider such an operation to be invalid. Another example of an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is when XAML namespace information is unavailable through the XAML schema context that applies to the current node stream position.       A <xref:System.Xaml.XamlXmlWriterException> indicates an exception where this particular XAML writer implementation chooses to throw an exception based on its intended functionality. A <xref:System.Xaml.XamlXmlWriterException> can indicate specific cases where a XamlXmlWriter violates its own state or settings. For example, a <xref:System.Xaml.XamlXmlWriterException> might result from attempts to write XAML namespace information into a position that the XamlXmlWriter and its serialization format do not support, or writing duplicate members when the instance&quot;s <xref:System.Xaml.XamlXmlWriterSettings> forbid it."
