  summary: "Contains a collection of <see cref=&quot;T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart&quot;></see> controls used for editing the properties, layout, appearance, and behavior of <see cref=&quot;T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart&quot;></see> controls. This class cannot be inherited."
  remarks: "The EditorPartCollection class is a read-only collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls, typically used by an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> zone to track the set of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls contained by the zone.       When a Web Parts page enters edit mode, and a user selects a control to edit, the editing process begins. The zone creates a new EditorPartCollection object consisting of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls contained by the zone. At various phases in the editing process, the zone accesses the EditorPartCollection object to save or retrieve property values between the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls in the collection and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control currently being edited.       You can create an EditorPartCollection collection of controls for your own programmatic use if, for example, you need to perform some mass operation on a set of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls. Even though the EditorPartCollection object is read-only, you can make programmatic changes to the properties of the underlying controls referenced in the collection."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates several uses of the EditorPartCollection class. There are four parts to this code example:  \n  \n-   A user control that enables you to change display modes on a Web Parts page.  \n  \n-   A class for a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control named `TextDisplayWebPart`, which is referenced in the Web page and is edited by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls.  \n  \n-   A Web page that references the `TextDisplayWebPart` control, contains an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> control with several of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls from the Web Parts control set declared in the zone, and contains some event-driven code to create and manipulate an EditorPartCollection object.  \n  \n-   An explanation of how the code example works when you load it in a browser.  \n  \n The first part of this code example is the user control that enables users to change display modes on a Web page. For details about display modes and a description of the source code in this control, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Changing%20Display%20Modes%20on%20a%20Web%20Parts%20Page.md).  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_EditorPartCollection_Overview#4](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_211_1.ascx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_EditorPartCollection_Overview#4](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_211_1.ascx)]  \n  \n The second part of the code example is the `TextDisplayWebPart` control. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. For a walkthrough that demonstrates both methods of compiling, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Developing%20and%20Using%20a%20Custom%20Web%20Server%20Control.md).  \n  \n Note that the control has a property named `ContentText`; this property holds the value that the user enters in the text box. This custom property can be edited when the control is in edit mode, along with the standard <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control properties.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_EditorPartCollection_Overview#3](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_211_2.cs)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_EditorPartCollection_Overview#3](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_211_2.vb)]  \n  \n The third part of the code example is the Web page. Notice that the `<asp:editorzone>` element for the page contains declarations for three <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls. Two of these controls become part of a custom EditorPartCollection object that is created when the `Button1_Click` method executes.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_EditorPartCollection_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_211_3.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_EditorPartCollection_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_211_3.aspx)]  \n  \n When you load the page in a browser, you can switch the page into edit mode by selecting **Edit** in the **Display Mode** drop-down list control. You can click the verbs menu (the downward arrow) in the title bar of the `TextDisplayWebPart` control, and click **Edit** to edit the control. When the editing user interface (UI) is visible, you can see all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls. You click the **Create EditorPartCollection** button to see the effects on the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls that are created by the code that is manipulating the EditorPartCollection object. Also, notice that the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PropertyGridEditorPart> control allows you to edit the custom `TextDisplayWebPart.ContentText` property. This is possible because the property is marked with a `WebBrowsable` attribute in the source code for the control. If you update the property value in the editing UI, you must return the page to normal browse mode to see the effect of updating the `TextDisplayWebPart.ContentText` property."

  remarks: "The EditorPartCollection constructor initializes an instance of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPartCollection> class and passes in a collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls. This is one overload of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPartCollection.%23ctor%2A> constructor that you can use to create a new <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPartCollection> object and add <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls to it.       Even though the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPartCollection> instance created by the constructor is read-only, you can still access the individual <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls in the collection programmatically and call their properties and methods.       One common scenario for using the EditorPartCollection constructor would be if you want to perform some batch operation on an entire set of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls, such as changing the content, appearance, or position of a related group of them.       Another common scenario for using the EditorPartCollection constructor is developing custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls that you want to associate with a server control, so that users can edit custom properties on your control. In this scenario, your server control must implement the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable> interface, and as part of that task, it must implement the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable.CreateEditorParts%2A> method. In that method, to enable the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls to edit your server control, you must add the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls to an <xref:System.Collections.ICollection> instance, such as an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> object. Then you can pass the collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPartCollection.%23ctor%2A> constructor to create a new <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPartCollection> object, which the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> zone uses to set up all the controls and begin the editing process."
