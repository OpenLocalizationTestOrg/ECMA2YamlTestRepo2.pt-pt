  type: Class
  summary: "Validates user credentials and manages user settings. This class cannot be inherited."
  remarks: "The Membership class is used in ASP.NET applications to validate user credentials and manage user settings such as passwords and e-mail addresses. The Membership class can be used on its own, or in conjunction with the <xref:System.Web.Security.FormsAuthentication> to create a complete system for authenticating users of a Web application or site. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Login> control encapsulates the Membership class to provide a convenient mechanism for validating users.      > [!NOTE] >  If you are not familiar with the membership features of ASP.NET, see [Introduction to Membership](../Topic/Introduction%20to%20Membership.md) before continuing. For a list of other topics related to membership, see [Managing Users by Using Membership](../Topic/Managing%20Users%20by%20Using%20Membership.md).       The Membership class provides facilities for:      -   Creating new users.      -   Storing membership information (user names, passwords, e-mail addresses, and supporting data) in Microsoft SQL Server or in an alternative data store.      -   Authenticating users who visit your site. You can authenticate users programmatically, or you can use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Login> control to create a complete authentication system that requires little or no code.      -   Managing passwords, which includes creating, changing, retrieving, and resetting them, and so on. You can optionally configure ASP.NET membership to require a password question and answer to authenticate password reset or retrieval requests for users that have forgotten their password.       Although ASP.NET membership is a self-standing feature in ASP.NET For authentication, it can be integrated with ASP.NET role management to provide authorization services for your site. Membership can also be integrated with the ASP.NET user <xref:System.Web.Profile> to provide application-specific customization that can be tailored to individual users. For details, see [Understanding Role Management](../Topic/Understanding%20Role%20Management.md) and [ASP.NET Profile Properties Overview](../Topic/ASP.NET%20Profile%20Properties%20Overview.md).       The Membership class relies on membership providers to communicate with a data source. The .NET Framework includes a <xref:System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider>, which stores user information in a Microsoft SQL Server database, and an <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider>, which enables you to store user information on an Active Directory or Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM) server. You can also implement a custom membership provider to communicate with an alternative data source that can be used by the Membership class. Custom membership providers inherit the <xref:System.Web.Security.MembershipProvider> abstract class. For more information, see [Implementing a Membership Provider](../Topic/Implementing%20a%20Membership%20Provider.md).       By default, ASP.NET membership is enabled for all ASP.NET applications. The default membership provider is the <xref:System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider> and is specified in the machine configuration with the name `AspNetSqlProvider`. The default instance of the <xref:System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider> is configured to connect to a local instance of Microsoft SQL Server.       You can modify the default settings to specify a <xref:System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider> other than the `AspNetSqlProvider` instance as the default provider, or specify an instance of a custom provider as the default provider for your ASP.NET application using the Web.config file. You can specify the ASP.NET membership configuration for your Web application using the  configuration section in the Web.config file. You can use the `providers` subsection of the  section to specify a membership provider other than one of the default providers. For example, the following  section removes the default membership providers from the current application configuration and adds a new provider with a name of `SqlProvider` that connects to a SQL Server instance named `AspSqlServer`.      ```   <configuration>     <connectionStrings>       <add name=&quot;SqlServices&quot; connectionString=&quot;Data Source=AspSqlServer;Integrated Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=aspnetdb;&quot; />     </connectionStrings>     <system.web>       <membership defaultProvider=&quot;SqlProvider&quot; userIsOnlineTimeWindow=&quot;20&quot;>         <providers>           <remove name=&quot;AspNetSqlProvider&quot; />           <add name=&quot;SqlProvider&quot;             type=&quot;System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider&quot;             connectionStringName=&quot;SqlServices&quot;             enablePasswordRetrieval=&quot;false&quot;             enablePasswordReset=&quot;true&quot;             requiresQuestionAndAnswer=&quot;true&quot;             passwordFormat=&quot;Hashed&quot;             applicationName=&quot;/&quot; />         </providers>       </membership>     </system.web>   </configuration>   ```"
  example:
  - "The following code example shows the login page for an ASP.NET application configured to use forms authentication and ASP.NET membership. If the supplied user credentials are invalid, a message is displayed to the user. Otherwise, the user is redirected to the originally requested URL using the <xref:System.Web.Security.FormsAuthentication.RedirectFromLoginPage%2A> method.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The ASP.NET login controls (<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Login>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.LoginView>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.LoginStatus>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.LoginName>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.PasswordRecovery>) encapsulate virtually all of the logic required to prompt users for credentials and validate the credentials in the membership system and can be used in place of programmatic checking using the Membership class.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  This example contains a text box that accepts user input, which is a potential security threat.

  summary: "Gets or sets the name of the application."
  remarks: "The ApplicationName is used to identify users specific to an application. That is, the same user name can exist in the database for multiple ASP.NET applications that specify a different ApplicationName. This enables multiple applications to use the same database to store user information without running into duplicate user name conflicts. Alternatively, multiple ASP.NET applications can use the same user database by specifying the same ApplicationName. The ApplicationName can be set programmatically or declaratively in the configuration for the Web application.      > [!CAUTION] >  Because a single default membership provider instance is used for all of the requests served by an <xref:System.Web.HttpApplication> object, you can have multiple requests executing concurrently and attempting to set the ApplicationName property value. The ApplicationName property is not thread safe for multiple writes, and changing the ApplicationName property value can result in unexpected behavior for multiple users of an application. We recommend that you avoid writing code that allows users to set the ApplicationName property, unless you must. An example of an application where setting the ApplicationName property may be required is an administrative application that manages membership data for multiple applications. Such an application should be a single-user application and not a Web application."

The `pageIndex` parameter identifies which page of results to return, where 0 identifies the first page. The `totalRecords` parameter is an `out` parameter that is set to the total number of membership users for the configured `applicationName`.

  summary: "Gets the time window between which consecutive failed attempts to provide a valid password or password answer are tracked."
  remarks: "The PasswordAttemptWindow property works in conjunction with the <xref:System.Web.Security.Membership.MaxInvalidPasswordAttempts%2A> property to help guard against an unwanted source guessing the password or password answer of a membership user through repeated attempts. When a user attempts to log in with, change, or reset his or her password, only a certain number of consecutive attempts are allowed within a specified time window. The length of this time window is specified in the PasswordAttemptWindow property, which identifies the number of minutes allowed between invalid attempts.       If the number of consecutive failed attempts that a user makes to reset his or her password equals the value stored in the <xref:System.Web.Security.Membership.MaxInvalidPasswordAttempts%2A> property, and the time elapsed since the last invalid attempt is less than the number of minutes specified in the PasswordAttemptWindow property, then the membership user is locked out. The user is locked out by setting the <xref:System.Web.Security.MembershipUser.IsLockedOut%2A> property to `true` until the user is unlocked by a call to the <xref:System.Web.Security.MembershipUser.UnlockUser%2A> method.       If the interval between the current failed attempt and the last failed attempt is greater than the PasswordAttemptWindow property setting, the current invalid attempt is counted as the first. If a valid password answer is supplied before the maximum number of allowed invalid attempts is reached, the count of invalid password-answer attempts is set to 0 (zero). If a valid password is supplied before the maximum number of allowed invalid attempts is reached, the count of invalid password attempts and the count of invalid password-answer attempts are set to 0 (zero).       Invalid password and password-answer attempts accumulate independently of one another. For example, if the <xref:System.Web.Security.Membership.MaxInvalidPasswordAttempts%2A> is set to 5, and three invalid password attempts are made followed by two invalid password-answer attempts, two more invalid password attempts (or three more invalid password-answer attempts) must be made within PasswordAttemptWindow for the membership user to be locked out.       The PasswordAttemptWindow property value is set in the application configuration by using the `passwordAttemptWindow` attribute of the  configuration-element section.
