  summary: "Establishes a dependency relationship between an item stored in an ASP.NET application&quot;s <see cref=&quot;T:System.Web.Caching.Cache&quot;></see> object and a file, cache key, an array of either, or another CacheDependency object. The CacheDependency class monitors the dependency relationships so that when any of them changes, the cached item will be automatically removed."
  remarks: "If you add an item to the cache that is dependent on another object, such as a file or array of files, the dependent item is automatically removed from the cache when the object changes. For example, suppose you create a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> object based on data in an XML file. You can add the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> to the cache with a CacheDependency object that makes the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> dependent on the XML file. If the XML file changes, the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> is removed from the cache.       You can add items with dependencies to your application&quot;s cache with the <xref:System.Web.Caching.Cache.Add%2A> and <xref:System.Web.Caching.Cache.Insert%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods. You cannot use the <xref:System.Web.Caching.Cache.Item%2A> property to add items to the cache with dependencies.       To set up a dependency, you create an instance of the CacheDependency class, specifying the files, keys, or directories on which the item is dependent, and then pass the dependency to the <xref:System.Web.Caching.Cache.Add%2A> or <xref:System.Web.Caching.Cache.Insert%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. The CacheDependency instance can represent a single file or directory, an array of files or directories, or an array of files or directories along with an array of cache keys (these represent other items stored in the <xref:System.Web.Caching.Cache> object)."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates using the <xref:System.Web.Caching.CacheDependency.HasChanged%2A> property to determine whether a CacheDependency changed since the previous request for an item in the <xref:System.Web.Caching.Cache>. The `dt` value passed in the `start` parameter is set to <xref:System.DateTime.Now%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.  \n  \n [!code-vb[System.Web.Caching.CacheDependency_HasChanged#1](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.web.caching.cac_3_1.aspx)]\n [!code-cs[System.Web.Caching.CacheDependency_HasChanged#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.web.caching.cac_3_1.aspx)]"

  summary: "Initializes a new instance of the <see cref=&quot;T:System.Web.Caching.CacheDependency&quot;></see> class that monitors an array of paths (to files or directories), an array of cache keys, or both for changes. It also makes itself dependent upon another instance of the <see cref=&quot;T:System.Web.Caching.CacheDependency&quot;></see> class and a time when the change monitoring begins."
  remarks: "Also, if any of the directories or files specified in the `filenames` parameter is not found in the file system, it is treated as missing. If a directory or file is missing when the object with the dependency is added to the <xref:System.Web.Caching.Cache>, the cached object will be removed from the <xref:System.Web.Caching.Cache> when that directory or file is created.  \n  \n For example, assume that you add an object to the <xref:System.Web.Caching.Cache> with a dependency on the following file path: c:\\stocks\\xyz.dat. If that file is not found when the <xref:System.Web.Caching.CacheDependency> object is created, but is created later, the cached object is removed upon the creation of the xyz.dat file.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Change tracking begins immediately and is not directly based on the `start` parameter. Use the `start` parameter to pass a date and time in the past against which you want to check the last modified date of any of the objects passed in the `filenames`, `cachekeys`, or `dependency` parameters. If the last modified date for any of those objects is later than the date and time passed in the `start` parameter, the cached item is removed from the <xref:System.Web.Caching.Cache>."
  example:
  - "The following code example shows a `CreateDependency` method. When this method is called, it creates a <xref:System.DateTime> object and the <xref:System.Web.Caching.Cache.Item%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property is used to add an item to the cache with a key parameter of `key1` and a value of `Value 1`. An array of strings, `dependencyKey`, is then created with the value at its first (and only) index set to the value of `key1` as well. The <xref:System.Web.Caching.CacheDependency.%23ctor%2A?displayProperty=fullName> constructor is then used to create a <xref:System.Web.Caching.CacheDependency> object, `dep1`, which passes `dependencyKey` as a parameter argument. A second <xref:System.Web.Caching.CacheDependency> object, `dep2`, is then created using this constructor, with `dep1` and the <xref:System.DateTime> object passed as parameter arguments. This second dependency is dependent on the first, and dependency monitoring will begin 10 seconds after the `CreateDependency` method is called. The <xref:System.Web.Caching.Cache.Insert%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method is called next, using the second <xref:System.Web.Caching.CacheDependency> object as a parameter. If the first dependency changes in any way, the cached item will be invalidated.  \n  \n [!code-cs[CacheDependency Constructor8#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/b4a521ab-493f-41c7-94fa-_1.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[CacheDependency Constructor8#1](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/b4a521ab-493f-41c7-94fa-_1.aspx)]"
