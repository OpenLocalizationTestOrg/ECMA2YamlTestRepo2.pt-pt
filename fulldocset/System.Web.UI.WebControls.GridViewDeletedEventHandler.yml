  summary: "Represents the method that handles the <xref href=&quot;System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowDeleted&quot;></xref> event of a <xref href=&quot;System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView&quot;></xref> control."
  remarks: "The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowDeleted> event when a Delete button (a button with its `CommandName` property set to &quot;Delete&quot;) within the control is clicked, but after the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control deletes the record. This allows you to provide an event-handling method that performs a custom routine, such as checking the results of a delete operation, whenever this event occurs.       When you create a GridViewDeletedEventHandler delegate, you identify the method that will handle the event. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The event handler is called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the delegate. For more information about event-handler delegates, see [NIB: Events and Delegates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d98fd58b-fa4f-4598-8378-addf4355a115)."
