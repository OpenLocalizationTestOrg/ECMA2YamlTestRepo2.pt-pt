  summary: "Contains a list of possible states for the audio input to a speech recognition engine."
  remarks: "You can obtain the audio input state of the speech recognition engine with the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.AudioState%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.AudioState%2A?displayProperty=fullName> properties. The <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.AudioStateChanged?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.AudioStateChanged?displayProperty=fullName> events are raised when the audio input state of a speech recognition engine changes."
  example:
  - "The following example demonstrates an event handler that handles the changing audio state of a speech recognizer.  \n  \n```c#  \n  \nprivate SpeechRecognitionEngine sre;  \n  \n// Initializes the speech recognition engine.  \nprivate void Initialize()  \n{  \n  sre = new SpeechRecognitionEngine();  \n  \n  // Add a handler for the AudioStateChanged event.  \n  sre.AudioStateChanged += new EventHandler<AudioStateChangedEventArgs>(sre_AudioStateChanged);  \n  \n  // Add other initialization code here.  \n}  \n  \n  // Handle the AudioStateChanged event.  \n  void sre_AudioStateChanged(object sender, AudioStateChangedEventArgs e)  \n{  \n  AudioState newState = e.AudioState;  \n  \n  // Handle event here.  \n}  \n  \n```"
