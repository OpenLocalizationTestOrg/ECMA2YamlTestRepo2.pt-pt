  summary: "Creates and controls a thread, sets its priority, and gets its status."
  remarks: "When a process starts, the common language runtime automatically creates a single foreground thread to execute application code. Along with this main foreground thread, a process can create one or more threads to execute a portion of the program code associated with the process. These threads can execute either in the foreground or in the background. In addition, you can use the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> class to execute code on worker threads that are managed by the common language runtime.  \n  \n In this section  \n  \n [Starting a thread](#Starting)   \n [Retrieving Thread objects](#Retrieving)   \n [Foreground and background threads](#Foreground)   \n [Culture and threads](#Culture)   \n [Getting information about and controlling threads](#Properties)   \n [Accessing the source code for the Thread class](#Source)  \n  \n<a name=\"Starting\"></a>   \n## Starting a thread  \n You start a thread by supplying a delegate that represents the method the thread is to execute in its class constructor. You then call the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Start%2A> method to begin execution.  \n  \n The Thread constructors can take either of two delegate types, depending on whether you can pass an argument to the method to be executed:  \n  \n-   If the method has no arguments, you pass a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadStart> delegate to  the constructor. It has the signature:  \n  \n    ```c#  \n    public delegate void ThreadStart()  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Public Delegate Sub ThreadStart()  \n    ```  \n  \n     The following example creates and starts a thread that executes the `ExecuteInForeground` method. The method displays  information about some thread properties, then executes a loop in which it pauses for half a second and displays the elapsed number of seconds. When the thread has executed for at least five seconds, the loop ends and the thread terminates execution.  \n  \n     [!code-cs[System.Threading.Thread#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.threading.thread_1.cs)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Threading.Thread#1](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.threading.thread_1.vb)]  \n  \n-   If the method has an argument, you pass a <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart> delegate to the constructor. It has the signature:  \n  \n    ```c#  \n    public delegate void ParameterizedThreadStart(object obj)  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Public Delegate Sub ParameterizedThreadStart(obj As Object)  \n    ```  \n  \n     The method executed by the delegate can then cast (in C#) or convert (in Visual Basic) the parameter to the appropriate type.  \n  \n     The following example is identical to the previous one, except that it calls the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.%23ctor%28System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart%29> constructor. This version of the `ExecuteInForeground` method has a single parameter that represents the approximate number of milliseconds the loop is to execute.  \n  \n     [!code-cs[System.Threading.Thread#2](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.threading.thread_2.cs)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Threading.Thread#2](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.threading.thread_2.vb)]  \n  \n It is not necessary to retain a reference to a Thread object once you have started the thread. The thread continues to execute until the thread procedure is complete.  \n  \n<a name=\"Retrieving\"></a>   \n## Retrieving Thread objects  \n You can use the static (`Shared` in Visual Basic)  <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread%2A> property to retrieve a reference to the currently executing thread from the code that the thread is executing. The following example uses the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread%2A> property to display information about the main application thread, another foreground thread, a background thread, and a thread pool thread.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Threading.Thread#4](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.threading.thread_3.cs)]\n [!code-vb[System.Threading.Thread#4](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.threading.thread_3.vb)]  \n  \n<a name=\"Foreground\"></a>   \n## Foreground and background threads  \n Instances of the Thread class represent either foreground threads or background threads. Background threads are identical to foreground threads with one exception: a background thread does not keep a process running if all foreground threads have terminated. Once all foreground threads have been stopped, the runtime stops all background threads and shuts down.  \n  \n By default, the following threads execute in the foreground:  \n  \n-   The main application thread.  \n  \n-   All threads created by calling a Thread class constructor.  \n  \n The following threads execute in the background by default:  \n  \n-   Thread pool threads, which are a pool of worker threads maintained by the runtime.  You can configure the thread pool and schedule work on thread pool threads by using the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> class.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Task-based asynchronous operations automatically execute on thread pool threads. Task-based asynchronous operations use the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601> classes to implement the [task-based asynchronous pattern](../Topic/Task-based%20Asynchronous%20Pattern%20\\(TAP\\).md).  \n  \n-   All threads that enter the managed execution environment from unmanaged code.  \n  \n You can change a thread to execute in the background by setting the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.IsBackground%2A> property at any time.  Background threads are useful for any operation that should continue as long as an application is running but should not prevent the application from terminating, such as monitoring file system changes or incoming socket connections.  \n  \n The following example illustrates the difference between foreground and background threads. It is like the first example in the [Starting a thread](#Starting) section, except that it sets the thread to execute in the background before starting it. As the output shows, the loop is interrupted before it executes for five seconds.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Threading.Thread#3](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.threading.thread_4.cs)]\n [!code-vb[System.Threading.Thread#3](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.threading.thread_4.vb)]  \n  \n<a name=\"Culture\"></a>   \n## Culture and threads  \n Each thread has a culture, represented by the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture%2A> property, and a UI culture, represented by the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture%2A> property.  The current culture supports such culture-sensitive  operations as parsing and formatting, string comparison and sorting, and also controls the writing system and calendar used by a thread. The current UI culture provides for culture-sensitive retrieval of resources in resource files.  \n  \n When a new thread is instantiated, its culture and UI culture are defined by the current system culture and UI culture, and not by the culture and UI culture of the thread from which the new thread is created. This means, for example, that if the current system culture is English (United States) and the current culture of the primary application thread is French (France), the culture of a new thread created by calling the   <xref:System.Threading.Thread.%23ctor%28System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart%29> constructor from the primary thread is English (United States), and not French (France). For more information, see the \"Culture and threads\" section of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class topic.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  This is not true of threads that execute asynchronous operations for apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/add/includes/net-v46-md.md)] and later versions, In this case, the culture and UI culture is part of an asynchronous operations' context; the thread on which an asynchronous operation executes by default inherits the culture and UI culture of the thread from which the asynchronous operation was launched. For more information, see the \"Culture and task-based asynchronous operations\" section of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class topic.  \n  \n You can do either of the following to ensure that all of the threads executing in an application share the same culture and UI culture:  \n  \n-   You can pass a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents that culture to the <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart> delegate or the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem%28System.Threading.WaitCallback%2CSystem.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \n  \n-   For apps running on the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](~/add/includes/net-v45-md.md)] and later versions, you can define the culture and UI culture that is to be assigned to all threads created in an application domain by setting the value of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> properties. Note that this is a per-application domain setting.  \n  \n For more information and examples, see the \"Culture and threads\" section of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class topic.  \n  \n<a name=\"Properties\"></a>   \n## Getting information about and controlling threads  \n You can retrieve a number of property values that provide information about a thread. In some cases, you can also set these property values to control the operation of the thread. These thread properties include:  \n  \n-   A name. <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Name%2A> is a write-once property that you can use to identify a thread.  Its default value is `null`.  \n  \n-   A hash code, which you can retrieve by calling the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.GetHashCode%2A> method. The hash code can be used to uniquely identify a thread; for the lifetime of your thread, its hash code will not collide with the value from any other thread, regardless of the application domain from which you obtain the value.  \n  \n-   A thread ID. The value of the read-only <xref:System.Threading.Thread.ManagedThreadId%2A> property is assigned by the runtime and uniquely identifies a thread within its process.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  An operating-system [ThreadId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms683233.aspx) has no fixed relationship to a managed thread, because an unmanaged host can control the relationship between managed and unmanaged threads. Specifically, a sophisticated host can use the [CLR Hosting API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms404385.aspx) to schedule many managed threads against the same operating system thread, or to move a managed thread between different operating system threads.  \n  \n-   The thread's current state. For the duration of its existence, a thread is always in one or more of the states defined by the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState> property.  \n  \n-   A scheduling priority level, which is defined by the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPriority> property. Although you can set this value to request a thread's priority, it is not guaranteed to be honored by the operating system.  \n  \n-   The read-only <xref:System.Threading.Thread.IsThreadPoolThread%2A> property, which indicates whether a thread is  a thread pool thread.  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Threading.Thread.IsBackground%2A> property. For more information, see the [Foreground and background threads](#Foreground) section.  \n  \n<a name=\"Source\"></a>   \n## Accessing the source code for the Thread class  \n To view the .NET Framework source code for the Thread class, see the [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/threading/thread.cs#3980e012bae82e96). You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/)."

If a larger value is specified for `maxStackSize` when code is running with partial trust, `maxStackSize` is ignored and the default stack size is used. No exception is thrown. Code at any trust level can set `maxStackSize` to a value that is less than the default stack size.      > [!NOTE] >  If you are developing a fully trusted library that will be used by partially trusted code, and you need to start a thread that requires a large stack, you must assert full trust before creating the thread, or the default stack size will be used. Do not do this unless you fully control the code that runs on the thread.       If `maxStackSize` is less than the minimum stack size, the minimum stack size is used. If `maxStackSize` is not a multiple of the page size, it is rounded to the next larger multiple of the page size. For example, if you are using the .NET Framework version 2.0 on Windows Vista, 256KB (262,144 bytes) is the minimum stack size, and the page size is 64KB (65,536 bytes).      > [!NOTE] >  On versions of Microsoft Windows prior to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, `maxStackSize` is ignored, and the stack size specified in the executable header is used.       If you specify a very small stack size, you might need to disable stack-overflow probing. When the stack is severely constrained, the probing can itself cause a stack overflow. To disable stack overflow probing, add the following to your application configuration file.      ```   <configuration>     <runtime>       <disableStackOverflowProbing enabled=&quot;true&quot;/>     </runtime>   </configuration>   ```"

  summary: "Notifies a host that execution is about to enter a region of code in which the effects of a thread abort or unhandled exception might jeopardize other tasks in the application domain."
  remarks: "Hosts of the common language runtime (CLR), such as Microsoft SQL Server 2005, can establish different policies for failures in critical and non-critical regions of code. A critical region is one in which the effects of a thread abort or an unhandled exception might not be limited to the current task. By contrast, an abort or failure in a non-critical region of code affects only the task in which the error occurs.       For example, consider a task that attempts to allocate memory while holding a lock. If the memory allocation fails, aborting the current task is not sufficient to ensure stability of the <xref:System.AppDomain>, because there can be other tasks in the domain waiting for the same lock. If the current task is terminated, other tasks could be deadlocked.       When a failure occurs in a critical region, the host might decide to unload the entire <xref:System.AppDomain> rather than take the risk of continuing execution in a potentially unstable state. To inform the host that your code is entering a critical region, call BeginCriticalRegion. Call <xref:System.Threading.Thread.EndCriticalRegion%2A> when execution returns to a non-critical region of code.       Using this method in code that runs under SQL Server 2005 requires the code to be run at the highest host protection level."

  summary: "Notifies a host that managed code is about to execute instructions that depend on the identity of the current physical operating system thread."
  remarks: "Some hosts of the common language runtime, such as Microsoft SQL Server 2005, provide their own thread management. A host that provides its own thread management can move an executing task from one physical operating system thread to another at any time. Most tasks are not affected by this switching. However, some tasks have thread affinity - that is, they depend on the identity of a physical operating system thread. These tasks must inform the host when they execute code that should not be switched.

  summary: "Notifies a host that execution is about to enter a region of code in which the effects of a thread abort or unhandled exception are limited to the current task."
  remarks: "Hosts of the common language runtime (CLR), such as Microsoft SQL Server 2005, can establish different policies for failures in critical and non-critical regions of code. A critical region is one in which the effects of a thread abort or an unhandled exception might not be limited to the current task. By contrast, an abort or failure in a non-critical region of code affects only the task in which the error occurs.       For example, consider a task that attempts to allocate memory while holding a lock. If the memory allocation fails, aborting the current task is not sufficient to ensure stability of the <xref:System.AppDomain>, because there can be other tasks in the domain waiting for the same lock. If the current task is terminated, other tasks could be deadlocked.       When a failure occurs in a critical region, the host might decide to unload the entire <xref:System.AppDomain> rather than take the risk of continuing execution in a potentially unstable state. To inform the host that your code is entering a critical region, call <xref:System.Threading.Thread.BeginCriticalRegion%2A>. Call EndCriticalRegion when execution returns to a non-critical region of code.       Using this method in code that runs under SQL Server 2005 requires the code to be run at the highest host protection level."

  summary: "Notifies a host that managed code has finished executing instructions that depend on the identity of the current physical operating system thread."
  remarks: "Some hosts of the common language runtime, such as Microsoft SQL Server 2005, provide their own thread management. A host that provides its own thread management can move an executing task from one physical operating system thread to another at any time. Most tasks are not affected by this switching. However, some tasks have thread affinity - that is, they depend on the identity of a physical operating system thread. These tasks must inform the host when they execute code that should not be switched.       For example, if your application calls a system API to acquire an operating system lock that has thread affinity, such as a Win32 CRITICAL_SECTION, you must call <xref:System.Threading.Thread.BeginThreadAffinity%2A> before acquiring the lock, and EndThreadAffinity after releasing the lock.

Thread-relative static fields provide much better performance than data slots, and enable compile-time type checking. For more information about using TLS, see [Thread Local Storage: Thread-Relative Static Fields and Data Slots](../Topic/Thread%20Local%20Storage:%20Thread-Relative%20Static%20Fields%20and%20Data%20Slots.md).       After any thread calls `FreeNamedDataSlot`, any other thread that calls <xref:System.Threading.Thread.GetNamedDataSlot%2A> with the same name will allocate a new slot associated with the name. Subsequent calls to `GetNamedDataSlot` by any thread will return the new slot. However, any thread that still has a <xref:System.LocalDataStoreSlot?displayProperty=fullName> returned by an earlier call to `GetNamedDataSlot` can continue to use the old slot.       A slot that has been associated with a name is released only when every `LocalDataStoreSlot` that was obtained prior to the call to `FreeNamedDataSlot` has been released and garbage-collected.       Threads use a local store memory mechanism to store thread-specific data. The common language runtime allocates a multi-slot data store array to each process when it is created. The thread can allocate a data slot in the data store, store and retrieve a data value in the slot, and free the slot for reuse after the thread expires. Data slots are unique per thread.

The thread can allocate a data slot in the data store, store and retrieve a data value in the slot, and free the slot for reuse after the thread expires. Data slots are unique per thread. No other thread (not even a child thread) can get that data.      > [!NOTE] >  GetData is a `Shared` method that always applies to the currently executing thread, even if you call it using a variable that refers to another thread. To avoid confusion, use the class name when calling `Shared` methods: `Dim test As Object = Thread.GetData(testSlot)`."

  summary: "Sets the data in the specified slot on the currently running thread, for that thread&quot;s current domain. For better performance, use fields marked with the &lt;xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute&gt; attribute instead."
  remarks: "> [!IMPORTANT] >  The .NET Framework provides two mechanisms for using thread local storage (TLS): thread-relative static fields (that is, fields that are marked with the <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> attribute) and data slots. Thread-relative static fields provide much better performance than data slots, and enable compile-time type checking. For more information about using TLS, see [Thread Local Storage: Thread-Relative Static Fields and Data Slots](../Topic/Thread%20Local%20Storage:%20Thread-Relative%20Static%20Fields%20and%20Data%20Slots.md).       Threads use a local store memory mechanism to store thread-specific data. The common language runtime allocates a multi-slot data store array to each process when it is created. The thread can allocate a data slot in the data store, store and retrieve a data value in the slot, and free the slot for reuse after the thread procedure ends and the <xref:System.Threading.Thread> object has been reclaimed by garbage collection. Data slots are unique per thread. No other thread (not even a child thread) can get that data.      > [!NOTE] >  SetData is a `Shared` method that always applies to the currently executing thread, even if you call it using a variable that refers to another thread. To avoid confusion, use the class name when calling `Shared` methods: `Thread.SetData(testSlot, &quot;test data&quot;)`."

  summary: "Causes a thread to wait the number of times defined by the <span class=&quot;paramref&quot;>iterations</span> parameter."
  remarks: "The SpinWait method is useful for implementing locks. Classes in the .NET Framework, such as <xref:System.Threading.Monitor> and <xref:System.Threading.ReaderWriterLock>, use this method internally. SpinWait essentially puts the processor into a very tight loop, with the loop count specified by the `iterations` parameter. The duration of the wait therefore depends on the speed of the processor.       Contrast this with the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Sleep%2A> method. A thread that calls <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Sleep%2A> yields the rest of its current slice of processor time, even if the specified interval is zero. Specifying a non-zero interval for <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Sleep%2A> removes the thread from consideration by the thread scheduler until the time interval has elapsed.       SpinWait is not generally useful for ordinary applications. In most cases, you should use the synchronization classes provided by the .NET Framework; for example, call <xref:System.Threading.Monitor.Enter%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or a statement that wraps <xref:System.Threading.Monitor.Enter%2A?displayProperty=fullName> (`lock` in C# or `SyncLock` in Visual Basic).      > [!CAUTION] >  In the rare case where it is advantageous to avoid a context switch, such as when you know that a state change is imminent, make a call to the SpinWait method in your loop. The code SpinWait executes is designed to prevent problems that can occur on computers with multiple processors. For example, on computers with multiple Intel processors employing Hyper-Threading technology, SpinWait prevents processor starvation in certain situations."
