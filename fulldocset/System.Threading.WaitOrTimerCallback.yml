  type: Delegate
  summary: "Represents a method to be called when a <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle> is signaled or times out."
  remarks: "WaitOrTimerCallback represents a callback method that you want to execute when a registered wait handle times out or is signaled. Create the delegate by passing your callback method to the WaitOrTimerCallback constructor. Your method must have the signature shown here.       Create the registered wait handle by passing the WaitOrTimerCallback delegate and a <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle> to <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.RegisterWaitForSingleObject%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. Your callback method executes each time the <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle> times out or is signaled.       [Visual Basic]      > [!NOTE] >  Visual Basic users can omit the WaitOrTimerCallback constructor, and simply use the `AddressOf` operator when passing the callback method to <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.RegisterWaitForSingleObject%2A>. Visual Basic automatically calls the correct delegate constructor.       If you want to pass information to your callback method, create an object that contains the necessary information and pass it to <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.RegisterWaitForSingleObject%2A> when you create the registered wait handle. Each time your callback method executes, the `state` parameter contains this object.       For more information about using callback methods to synchronize thread pool threads, see [The Managed Thread Pool](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)."
  example:
  - "The following example shows how to use the WaitOrTimerCallback delegate to represent a callback method that is executed when a wait handle is signaled.  \n  \n The example also shows how to use the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.RegisterWaitForSingleObject%2A> method to execute a specified callback method when a specified wait handle is signaled. In this example, the callback method is `WaitProc` and the wait handle is an <xref:System.Threading.AutoResetEvent>.  \n  \n The example defines a `TaskInfo` class to hold the information that is passed to the callback when it executes. The example creates a `TaskInfo` object and assigns it some string data. The <xref:System.Threading.RegisteredWaitHandle> that is returned by the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.RegisterWaitForSingleObject%2A> method is assigned to the `Handle` field of the `TaskInfo` object, so that the callback method has access to the <xref:System.Threading.RegisteredWaitHandle>.  \n  \n In addition to the `TaskInfo` object, the call to the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.RegisterWaitForSingleObject%2A> method specifies the <xref:System.Threading.AutoResetEvent> the task waits on, a WaitOrTimerCallback delegate that represents the `WaitProc` callback method, a one-second timeout interval, and multiple callbacks.  \n  \n When the main thread signals the <xref:System.Threading.AutoResetEvent> by calling its <xref:System.Threading.EventWaitHandle.Set%2A> method, the WaitOrTimerCallback delegate is invoked. The `WaitProc` method tests <xref:System.Threading.RegisteredWaitHandle> to determine whether a timeout occurred. If the callback was invoked because the wait handle was signaled, the `WaitProc` method unregisters the <xref:System.Threading.RegisteredWaitHandle>, stopping further callbacks. In the case of a timeout, the task continues waiting. The `WaitProc` method ends by printing a message to the console.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Threading.ThreadPool RegisterWaitForSingleObject0#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.threading.waito_1.cs)]\n [!code-cpp[System.Threading.ThreadPool RegisterWaitForSingleObject0#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.threading.waito_1.cpp)]\n [!code-vb[System.Threading.ThreadPool RegisterWaitForSingleObject0#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.threading.waito_1.vb)]"
