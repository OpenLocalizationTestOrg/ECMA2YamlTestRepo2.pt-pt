  summary: "Represents and identifies a routed event and declares its characteristics."
  remarks: "This class contains the <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEvent.Name%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEvent.RoutingStrategy%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEvent.HandlerType%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEvent.OwnerType%2A> properties. None of these members can have null values.       This class has a XAML usage that is exclusively intended for providing the value of the <xref:System.Windows.EventTrigger.RoutedEvent%2A> property of an <xref:System.Windows.EventTrigger> (or derived class), or for the <xref:System.Windows.EventSetter.Event%2A> property of an <xref:System.Windows.EventSetter> (or derived class). For more information about <xref:System.Windows.EventTrigger>, <xref:System.Windows.EventSetter>, and the XAML usages for those classes, see [Routed Events Overview](../Topic/Routed%20Events%20Overview.md).      <a name=&quot;xamlAttributeUsage_RoutedEvent&quot;></a>    ## XAML Attribute Usage      ```   <object property=&quot;eventName&quot;/>   - or -   <object property=&quot;type.eventName&quot;/>      ```      <a name=&quot;xamlValues_RoutedEvent&quot;></a>    ## XAML Values    *eventName*    An unqualified event name, equivalent to the <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEvent.Name%2A> property of the RoutedEvent field, not the actual member name of the RoutedEvent identifier field within a type. Without qualification, *eventName* must name an event as found in the type that is the <xref:System.Windows.Style.TargetType%2A> of the current style containing the <xref:System.Windows.EventSetter> or <xref:System.Windows.EventTrigger>.       *type*    The type to use to qualify the event name. If provided without a prefix, *type* is expected to be a type within the default XAML namespace, and that can be mapped to an existing CLR type. For custom events, or events that are on types outside of the default XAML namespace, the string for *type* can include a prefix for a mapped XAML namespace. That XAML namespace should contain the XAML type that can map to a backing CLR type, and that CLR type should define the desired routed event identifier. For details on XAML namespace mapping, see [XAML Namespaces and Namespace Mapping for WPF XAML](../Topic/XAML%20Namespaces%20and%20Namespace%20Mapping%20for%20WPF%20XAML.md)."

  example:
  - "The following example adds the current class as another owner of an event defined in a different class. Here, `AnotherEditContainer` is the current class, and the `EditStateChangedEvent`<xref:System.Windows.RoutedEvent> field is defined as a member of that class.
