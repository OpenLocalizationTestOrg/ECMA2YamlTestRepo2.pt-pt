  summary: "Provides a &lt;xref:System.IO.Stream&gt; for a file, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous read and write operations.       To browse the .NET Framework source code for this type, see the [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/io/filestream.cs#e23a38af5d11ddd3)."
  remarks: "> [!NOTE]\n>  To view the .NET Framework source code for this type, see the [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/io/filestream.cs#e23a38af5d11ddd3). You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).  \n  \n Use the FileStream class to read from, write to, open, and close files on a file system, and to manipulate other file-related operating system handles, including pipes, standard input, and standard output. You can use the [Read(Byte\\[\\], Int32, Int32)](assetId:///M:System.IO.FileStream.Read(System.Byte[],System.Int32,System.Int32)?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True), [Write(Byte\\[\\], Int32, Int32)](assetId:///M:System.IO.FileStream.Write(System.Byte[],System.Int32,System.Int32)?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True), <xref:System.IO.Stream.CopyTo%2A>, and <xref:System.IO.FileStream.Flush%2A> methods to perform synchronous operations, or the <xref:System.IO.FileStream.ReadAsync%2A>, <xref:System.IO.FileStream.WriteAsync%2A>, <xref:System.IO.Stream.CopyToAsync%2A>, and <xref:System.IO.FileStream.FlushAsync%2A> methods to perform asynchronous operations. Use the asynchronous methods to perform resource-intensive file operations without blocking the main thread. This performance consideration is particularly important in a [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](~/add/includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] app or [!INCLUDE[desktop_appname](~/add/includes/desktop-appname-md.md)] app where a time-consuming stream operation can block the UI thread and make your app appear as if it is not working. FileStream buffers input and output for better performance.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  This type implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. When you have finished using the type, you should dispose of it either directly or indirectly. To dispose of the type directly, call its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method in a `try`/`catch` block. To dispose of it indirectly, use a language construct such as `using` (in C#) or `Using` (in Visual Basic). For more information, see the “Using an Object that Implements IDisposable” section in the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface topic.  \n  \n The <xref:System.IO.FileStream.IsAsync%2A> property detects whether the file handle was opened asynchronously. You specify this value when you create an instance of the FileStream class using a constructor that has an `isAsync`, `useAsync`, or `options` parameter. When the property is `true`, the stream utilizes overlapped I/O to perform file operations asynchronously. However, the <xref:System.IO.FileStream.IsAsync%2A> property does not have to be `true` to call the <xref:System.IO.FileStream.ReadAsync%2A>, <xref:System.IO.FileStream.WriteAsync%2A>, or <xref:System.IO.Stream.CopyToAsync%2A> method. When the <xref:System.IO.FileStream.IsAsync%2A> property is `false` and you call the asynchronous read and write operations, the UI thread is still not blocked, but the actual I/O operation is performed synchronously.  \n  \n The <xref:System.IO.FileStream.Seek%2A> method supports random access to files. <xref:System.IO.FileStream.Seek%2A> allows the read/write position to be moved to any position within the file. This is done with byte offset reference point parameters. The byte offset is relative to the seek reference point, which can be the beginning, the current position, or the end of the underlying file, as represented by the three members of the <xref:System.IO.SeekOrigin> enumeration.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Disk files always support random access. At the time of construction, the <xref:System.IO.FileStream.CanSeek%2A> property value is set to `true` or `false` depending on the underlying file type.If the underlying file type is FILE_TYPE_DISK, as defined in winbase.h, the <xref:System.IO.FileStream.CanSeek%2A> property value is `true`. Otherwise, the <xref:System.IO.FileStream.CanSeek%2A> property value is `false`.  \n  \n If a process terminates with part of a file locked or closes a file that has outstanding locks, the behavior is undefined.  \n  \n For directory operations and other file operations, see the <xref:System.IO.File>, <xref:System.IO.Directory>, and <xref:System.IO.Path> classes. The <xref:System.IO.File> class is a utility class that has static methods primarily for the creation of FileStream objects based on file paths. The <xref:System.IO.MemoryStream> class creates a stream from a byte array and is similar to the FileStream class.  \n  \n For a list of common file and directory operations, see [Common I/O Tasks](../Topic/Common%20I-O%20Tasks.md).  \n  \n## Detection of Stream Position Changes  \n When a FileStream object does not have an exclusive hold on its handle, another thread could access the file handle concurrently and change the position of the operating system's file pointer that is associated with the file handle. In this case, the cached position in the FileStream object and the cached data in the buffer could be compromised. The FileStream object routinely performs checks on methods that access the cached buffer to ensure that the operating system's handle position is the same as the cached position used by the FileStream object.  \n  \n If an unexpected change in the handle position is detected in a call to the <xref:System.IO.FileStream.Read%2A> method, the .NET Framework discards the contents of the buffer and reads the stream from the file again. This can affect performance, depending on the size of the file and any other processes that could affect the position of the file stream.  \n  \n If an unexpected change in the handle position is detected in a call to the <xref:System.IO.FileStream.Write%2A> method, the contents of the buffer are discarded and an <xref:System.IO.IOException> exception is thrown.  \n  \n A FileStream object will not have an exclusive hold on its handle when either the <xref:System.IO.FileStream.SafeFileHandle%2A> property is accessed to expose the handle or the FileStream object is given the <xref:System.IO.FileStream.SafeFileHandle%2A> property in its constructor."
  example:
  - "The following example demonstrates some of the FileStream constructors.  \n  \n [!code-cs[fstream class#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.io.filestream_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[fstream class#1](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.io.filestream_1.vb)]\n [!code-cpp[fstream class#1](~/add/codesnippet/CPP/t-system.io.filestream_1.cpp)]  \n  \n The following example shows how to write to a file asynchronously. This code runs in a WPF app that has a TextBlock named UserInput and a button hooked up to a Click event handler that is named Button_Click. The file path needs to be changed to a file than exits on the computer.  \n  \n [!code-vb[Asynchronous_File_IO_async#3](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.io.filestream_2.vb)]\n [!code-cs[Asynchronous_File_IO_async#3](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.io.filestream_2.cs)]"

  summary: "Initializes a new instance of the <see cref=&quot;T:System.IO.FileStream&quot;></see> class with the specified path, creation mode, access rights and sharing permission, the buffer size, additional file options, access control and audit security."
  remarks: "The .NET Framework does not support direct access to physical disks through paths that are device names, such as \"\\\\\\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE0 \".  \n  \n Use this FileStream constructor to apply access rights at the point of creation of a file. To access or modify rights on an existing file, consider using the <xref:System.IO.File.GetAccessControl%2A> and <xref:System.IO.File.SetAccessControl%2A> methods.  \n  \n The `fileOptions` parameter is used to provide access to more advanced operations that can be leveraged when creating a <xref:System.IO.FileStream> object.  \n  \n The `path` parameter can be a file name, including a file on a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) share.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  `path` is not required to be a file stored on disk; it can be any part of a system that supports access through streams. For example, depending on the system, this class can access a physical device.  \n  \n <xref:System.IO.Stream.CanSeek%2A> is `true` for all <xref:System.IO.FileStream> objects that encapsulate files. If `path` indicates a device that does not support seeking, the <xref:System.IO.FileStream.CanSeek%2A> property on the resulting <xref:System.IO.FileStream> is `false`. For additional information, see <xref:System.IO.Stream.CanSeek%2A>.  \n  \n> [!CAUTION]\n>  When you compile a set of characters with a particular cultural setting and retrieve those same characters with a different cultural setting, the characters might not be interpretable, and could cause an exception to be thrown.  \n  \n For a list of common file and directory operations, see [Common I/O Tasks](../Topic/Common%20I-O%20Tasks.md)."

These methods are still available in the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](~/add/includes/net-v45-md.md)] to support legacy code; however, the new async methods, such as <xref:System.IO.FileStream.ReadAsync%2A>, <xref:System.IO.FileStream.WriteAsync%2A>, <xref:System.IO.Stream.CopyToAsync%2A>, and <xref:System.IO.FileStream.FlushAsync%2A>, help you implement asynchronous file operations more easily.

  summary: "Clears buffers for this stream and causes any buffered data to be written to the file."
  remarks: "This method overrides <xref:System.IO.Stream.Flush%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.       When you call the Flush method, the operating system I/O buffer is also flushed.       A stream’s encoder is not flushed unless you explicitly call Flush or dispose of the object. Setting <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter.AutoFlush%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to `true` means that data will be flushed from the buffer to the stream, but the encoder state will not be flushed. This allows the encoder to keep its state (partial characters) so that it can encode the next block of characters correctly. This scenario affects UTF8 and UTF7 where certain characters can only be encoded after the encoder receives the adjacent character or characters.       Because a buffer can be used for either reading or writing, Flush performs the following two functions:      -   Any data previously written to the buffer is copied to the file and the buffer is cleared except for its encoder state.      -   If <xref:System.IO.BufferedStream.CanSeek%2A?displayProperty=fullName> is `true` and data was previously copied from the file to the buffer for reading, the current position within the file is decremented by the number of unread bytes in the buffer. The buffer is then cleared.       Use the <xref:System.IO.FileStream.Flush%28System.Boolean%29> method overload when you want to ensure that all buffered data in intermediate file buffers is written to disk."

Multiple threads cannot safely write to the same file simultaneously, and `FileStream` buffering code assumes that it exclusively controls the handle. `FileStream` might throw an <xref:System.IO.IOException> if `FileStream` detects that some other process has moved the file pointer.

You specify this value when you create an instance of the <xref:System.IO.FileStream> class using a constructor that has an `isAsync`, `useAsync`, or `options` parameter.

  summary: "Reads a block of bytes from the stream and writes the data in a given buffer."
  remarks: "This method overrides <xref:System.IO.Stream.Read%2A>.       The `offset` parameter gives the offset of the byte in `array` (the buffer index) at which to begin reading, and the `count` parameter gives the maximum number of bytes to be read from this stream. The returned value is the actual number of bytes read, or zero if the end of the stream is reached. If the read operation is successful, the current position of the stream is advanced by the number of bytes read. If an exception occurs, the current position of the stream is unchanged.       The Read method returns zero only after reaching the end of the stream. Otherwise, Read always reads at least one byte from the stream before returning. If no data is available from the stream upon a call to Read, the method will block until at least one byte of data can be returned. An implementation is free to return fewer bytes than requested even if the end of the stream has not been reached.       Use <xref:System.IO.BinaryReader> for reading primitive data types.       Do not interrupt a thread that is performing a read operation. Although the application may appear to run successfully after the thread is unblocked, the interruption can decrease your application&quot;s performance and reliability.

The async methods are used in conjunction with the `async` and `await` keywords in Visual Basic and C#.       Use the <xref:System.IO.FileStream.CanWrite%2A> property to determine whether the current instance supports reading.       If the operation is canceled before it completes, the returned task contains the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskStatus> value for the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Status%2A> property. If the handle to the file is disposed, the returned task contains the <xref:System.ObjectDisposedException> exception in the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Exception%2A> property."
