  summary: "Contains values that specify the dock position of an object, represented by a <see cref=&quot;T:System.Windows.Automation.DockPattern&quot;></see>, within a docking container."
  remarks: "A docking container is a control that allows the arrangement of child elements, both horizontally and vertically, relative to the boundaries of the docking container and other elements within the container.       Controls are docked relative to each other based on their current z-order; the higher their z-order placement, the further they are placed from the specified edge of the docking container."
