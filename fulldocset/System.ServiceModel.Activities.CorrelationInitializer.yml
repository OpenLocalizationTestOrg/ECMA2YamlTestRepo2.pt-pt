  summary: "An abstract base class for correlation initializers that are used to tell the runtime what protocol is being used for the correlation."
  remarks: "The runtime uses the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationInitializer.CorrelationHandle%2A> for correlation if it is present, otherwise the **CorrelatesWith** property of the messaging activity will be used.  If both are absent, the ambient handle provided by <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> or the workflow service is used."
