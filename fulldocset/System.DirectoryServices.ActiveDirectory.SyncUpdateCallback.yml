  summary: "Receives event notifications during a replica synchronization."
  remarks: "The <xref:System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.DomainController.SyncReplicaFromAllServers%2A>       operation takes a long time to complete and potentially could fail on a server.  The SyncUpdateCallback callback function enables the application to indicate whether the SyncReplicaFromAllServers method should continue executing.  For example, the application could return false to terminate <xref:System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.DirectoryServer.SyncReplicaFromAllServers%2A>       execution if an error occurs.  Another scenario in which this capability would be used is to terminate <xref:System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.DirectoryServer.SyncReplicaFromAllServers%2A>       execution once the application detects that synchronization has completed for a certain target server or source server pair."
