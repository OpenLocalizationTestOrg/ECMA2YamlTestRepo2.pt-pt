  summary: "Provides an application-level service that processes multitouch input from the operating system and raises the <xref href=&quot;System.Windows.Input.Touch.FrameReported&quot;></xref> event."
  remarks: "The <xref:System.Windows.Input.Touch.FrameReported> event is included in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)] to support compatibility with Silverlight. If you do not have to ensure compatibility with Silverlight, use the touch events, such as <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TouchDown> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TouchMove>, on <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D>, or <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement>.       The <xref:System.Windows.Input.Touch.FrameReported> event does not use the same event model as other WPF input events, such as <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TouchDown> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TouchMove>. Instead of being exposed as an element-specific event that potentially routes through the object tree of a UI, the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Touch.FrameReported> event is a single event that is handled at the application level. Therefore, you cannot use the `sender` parameter of the event handler to determine what element is touched.       Use the <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchFrameEventArgs> to get the <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchPoint> values that are relevant to the touch event. From the <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchPoint>, you can get the <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchPoint.Position%2A> of the touch and determine whether the <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchAction> was a <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchAction>, <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchAction>, or <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchAction> action. You can also use the <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchPoint> to get the <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchDevice>. From the <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchDevice>, you can determine the device <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchDevice.Id%2A> and get information about the element that is touched."
  example:
  - "The following example enables you to create simple patterns on a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> by dragging two fingers across a touchscreen. Each touch is represented by a <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchDevice>.The pattern is created by drawing a line between the touch points provided by the touches. This example requires a Windows Touchâ€“compatible screen.  \n  \n The following markup creates the user interface, which consists of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> that is centered in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>.  \n  \n [!code-xml[TouchFrameSample#000](~/add/codesnippet/xaml/wpftouchframesample/mainwindow.xaml#000)]  \n  \n The following code handles the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Touch.FrameReported> event. When a touch presses on the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>, the <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchDevice> is captured to the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>. When the touch is lifted, the <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchDevice> is released. When a touch moves across the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>, the <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchDevice.Id%2A> is checked. If the move came from the first touch, its location is recorded. If the move came from the second touch, a line is drawn from the position of the first touch to the position of the second touch.  \n  \n [!code-vb[TouchFrameSample#100](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/wpftouchframesample/mainwindow.xaml.vb#100)]\n [!code-cs[TouchFrameSample#100](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/wpftouchframesample/mainwindow.xaml.cs#100)]"

  summary: "Occurs when a touch message is sent."
  remarks: "A frame is one in a series of multitouch messages or touch points. You can respond to touches by handling the FrameReported event and accessing the details of the <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchPoint> from the <xref:System.Windows.Input.TouchFrameEventArgs> event data.       The FrameReported event does not use the same event model as other [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlewinclient](~/add/includes/tlasharptla-titlewinclient-md.md)] input events, such as <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TouchDown> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TouchMove>.
