  summary: "Defines the interface that bindings must implement to describe and advertise the capabilities that clients and services may require."
  remarks: "The IBindingDeliveryCapabilities interface must be implemented by a binding if clients and services are to be able to stipulate, as part of their contract, that the features they require are provided by the binding."
  example:
  - "The following sample requires that `CalculatorService` must use a <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> with ordered message delivery.
