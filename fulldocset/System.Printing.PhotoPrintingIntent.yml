  summary: "Specifies the quality of output when a photograph is printed. The printer driver translates the PhotoPrintingIntent into quantitative values for resolution and other quality factors."
  remarks: "The values of this type are used primarily for these purposes:      -   As members of the <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities.PhotoPrintingIntentCapability%2A> collection, which is a property of <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities>, they specify the quality levels that the printer supports.      -   As a <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket.PhotoPrintingIntent%2A> value, which is a property of <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket>, instructs the printer to use a particular quality.       The Unknown value is never used in properties of <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities> objects.       You should never set a <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> property to Unknown. If some other <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> producing application has created a PrintTicket document that sets the photo printing intent feature to an unrecognized option (that is, an option that is not defined in the [Print Schema](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186397)), then a <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> object in your application that is constructed with that document will have Unknown as the value of the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket.PhotoPrintingIntent%2A> property.       Although the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> and <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities> classes cannot be inherited, you can extend the [Print Schema](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186397) to recognize print device features that are not accounted for in the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> or <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities> classes. For more information, see [NOTINBUILD: How to: Extend the Print Schema and Create New Print System Classes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/a3600218-1ea5-478a-9853-6560464f2885)."
