  summary: "Defines identifiers for a set of technologies that designer hosts support."
  remarks: "The view adapter model replaces and adds functionality to the ViewTechnology feature; however, the ViewTechnology feature is retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose. For more information, see &quot;.NET Shape Library: A Sample Designer&quot; in the Windows Forms Knowledge Base at http://windowsforms.net/articles/shapedesigner.aspx.       ViewTechnology defines identifiers that can indicate the mode to use for controlling the display of a designer-hosted document.       You should only use the Default value in your designer hosting environment. In previous versions of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/add/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], the ViewTechnology enumeration specified the type of UI model supported by a root designer. Because this model is not extensible, you should instead use a *view adapter* model. A view adapter is a type that adapts an object of one type to another.       For example, an HTML designer might return a `DemoDOM` tree as its view. The HTML designer returns a view technology of Default. A Windows Forms hosting environment would have one or more view adapter classes available. If one such class could convert the `DemoDOM` into a Windows Forms control, the hosting application can support this type of designer. If no adapter can handle the data type returned from the designerâ€™s <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.IRootDesigner.GetView%2A> method, the load of the designer will fail, and the user will be presented with an error.       [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](~/add/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] has an extensible scheme for providing view adapters, so it can adapt to any UI technology. Third-party technology providers can also offer an appropriate view adapter, and their object models are immediately consumable.       For an example that uses view adapters, see &quot;.NET Shape Library: A Sample Designer&quot; in the Windows Forms Knowledge Base at http://windowsforms.net/articles/shapedesigner.aspx."
