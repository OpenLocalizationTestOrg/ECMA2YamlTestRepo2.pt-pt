  summary: "Represents the method that handles the <see cref=&quot;E:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart&quot;></see> event of a <see cref=&quot;T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager&quot;></see> object."
  remarks: "The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart> event is raised before a Web Parts control is added to a Web Parts zone. You can specify which Web Parts controls can be added to a zone by customizing how the event is handled. The method specified in the WebPartAuthorizationEventHandler delegate is called when an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart> event is raised.       Page developers can provide custom handlers for Web Parts events by adding an `OnAuthorizeWebPart` attribute to the `<asp:webpartmanager>` element in a page, and assigning a custom method name to the attribute. A custom handler can also be assigned programmatically. For more information on programmatically assigning an event handler, see [NIB: How to: Connect Event Handler Methods to Events](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/348e9600-22e3-49a2-8864-11c5bb3e98fc)."
