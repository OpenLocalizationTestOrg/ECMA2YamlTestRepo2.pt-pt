  summary: "Contains a read-only collection of <see cref=&quot;T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone&quot;></see> controls."
  remarks: "The WebPartZoneCollection class contains the collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> controls that exist on a Web Parts page. It is used primarily by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control to track and manage all the zones. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control keeps a reference to the collection of zones on a page in its read-only <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Zones%2A> property.       The WebPartZoneCollection class is useful when you want to carry out operations on multiple zones or their contents at the same time, or when you need to locate a particular zone and examine or change its contents. Although the collection of zones itself is read-only and you cannot change the size of the collection object itself, you can still get references to the individual zones within the collection, and when you have a reference to an individual zone object, you can change its property values.       The WebPartZoneCollection class has two constructors. The first one, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneCollection.%23ctor>, simply initializes an empty instance of a new WebPartZoneCollection. The second one, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneCollection.%23ctor%28System.Collections.ICollection%29>, initializes a collection by passing in an existing collection of zones.       The WebPartZoneCollection class contains an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneCollection.Item%2A> property. This property allows you to locate a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> control within the collection by passing in a string identifier. The zone is located by matching the string identifier to the value of the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.ID%2A> property on a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone.       The WebPartZoneCollection class also has several methods that are useful for examining or accessing its contents. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneCollection.Contains%2A> method determines whether a particular zone exists in the collection. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneCollection.CopyTo%2A> method copies the collection to an array of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> objects. Finally, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneCollection.IndexOf%2A> method returns the index of a particular zone within the collection."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates the use of the WebPartZoneCollection class. The code example contains three parts: two sections of code, and an explanation of how to run the example.  \n  \n The first part of the code example is a Web page that contains three <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> controls, each of which contains a single server control. Although these server controls are all standard ASP.NET controls, they can act as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls at run time because they are placed within a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> zone.  \n  \n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartZoneCollection_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_155_1.aspx)]\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartZoneCollection_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_155_1.aspx)]  \n  \n The second part of the code example is the partial class that contains the code to demonstrate usage of the WebPartZoneCollection class. This code handles the events for the Web page.  \n  \n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartZoneCollection_Overview#2](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_155_2.vb)]\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartZoneCollection_Overview#2](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_155_2.cs)]  \n  \n Load the page in a browser. The three <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> zones are visible with their contained server controls. Near the bottom of the page are several buttons, each of which demonstrates some aspect of working with the WebPartZoneCollection object. Click each button to see its effect on the zones and their contents. To view the code associated with each button that demonstrates some aspect of the WebPartZoneCollection object, view the code in the partial class file referenced above as the second part of this code example."

  remarks: "Use the WebPartZoneCollection constructor when you want to create a custom collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> objects to carry out programmatic operations on them. For example, you could access the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Zones%2A> property and create a subset of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> objects on a Web Parts page, assigning them to a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneCollection> object, and then carry out operations on the child controls or various properties of only that subset of zones."

  - "The following code example demonstrates the use of the WebPartZoneCollection constructor. The complete code for the example is found in the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneCollection> class overview.  \n  \n In the following section of code, notice that it assigns a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneCollection> object to a variable by retrieving the value of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Zones%2A> property. If you wanted, rather than assigning all the zones from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Zones%2A> property, you could create an array of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> objects containing a subset of all the zones on the page, and assign the array to a new <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneCollection> object.  \n  \n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartZoneCollection_Overview#6](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/deb6771b-b88d-4f7b-8ccc-_1.vb)]\n [!code-cs[WebParts_WebPartZoneCollection_Overview#6](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/deb6771b-b88d-4f7b-8ccc-_1.cs)]  \n  \n After the collection is created, you can easily iterate through the collection and perform operations on all the contained zones or their contents. To execute the example code, load the page in a browser, and click the **Toggle Verb Render Mode** button on each zone. This alternates how the verbs in the title bar of each server control contained in a zone are rendered. The verbs can appear in a drop-down menu, or directly as links in the title bar."
