    > [!IMPORTANT]

    >  There are two thread state enumerations, ThreadState and <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState?displayProperty=fullName>.  The thread state enumerations are only of interest in a few debugging scenarios. Your code should never use thread state to synchronize the activities of threads.
