  summary: "Represents the method that will handle the <see cref=&quot;E:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartAdded&quot;></see> event, <see cref=&quot;E:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartDeleted&quot;></see> event, <see cref=&quot;E:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartClosed&quot;></see> event, <see cref=&quot;E:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartMoved&quot;></see> event, or <see cref=&quot;E:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPartChanged&quot;></see> event of a <see cref=&quot;T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager&quot;></see> object."
  remarks: "The method specified in the WebPartEventHandler delegate will be called when a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartAdded> event, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartDeleted> event, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartClosed> event, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartMoved> event, or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPartChanged> event is raised.       Page developers can provide custom handlers for Web Parts events by adding an `OnWebPartAdded` attribute, `OnWebPartDeleted` attribute, `OnWebPartClosed` attribute, `OnWebPartMoved` attribute, or `OnSelectedWebPartChanged` attribute to the `<asp:webpartmanager>` element in a page, and assigning a custom method name to the attribute. A custom handler can also be assigned programmatically. For more information on programmatically assigning an event handler, see [NIB: How to: Connect Event Handler Methods to Events](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/348e9600-22e3-49a2-8864-11c5bb3e98fc)."
