  summary: "Enumerates values of the recognizer&quot;s state."
  remarks: "RecognizerState encapsulates the running state of the default speech recognition engine for clients using <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer> to access the Windows Desktop Speech Recognition Technology service.       Applications can obtain the current state of the desktop recognition engine as a RecognizerState object by querying the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.State%2A> property on a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer> instance.  To obtain the state of the desktop recognition engine after it changes, applications can query the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.StateChangedEventArgs.RecognizerState%2A> property of the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.StateChangedEventArgs> object passed to a handler for <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.StateChanged> events.      > [!NOTE] >  <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine> instances run in-process and their running state is under the control of the application. Therefore, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine> does not contain a property to return a RecognizerState object.       The state of a desktop speech recognition server is a read-only property and cannot be controlled programmatically. Users can change a shared speech recognizer&quot;s state using the Speech Recognition user interface (UI) or through the **Speech Recognition** member of the Windows **Control Panel**.       Both the **On** and **Sleep** settings in the Speech Recognition UI correspond to the `Listening` state. The **Off** setting in the Speech Recognition UI corresponds to Stopped.       <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.Enabled%2A> is the other property that affects the readiness of a shared speech recognition engine to receive and process speech input. You can use <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.Enabled%2A> to control whether or not a shared speech recognition engine&quot;s grammars are active for recognition. However, changing the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.Enabled%2A> property has no effect on the RecognizerState property.       Information such as the description, the supported culture and audio formats, and the recognition engine name is encapsulated in the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognizerInfo> type."
  example:
  - "In the example below, an application displays the state of a recognizer in its implementation of a handler for the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.StateChanged> event.  \n  \n```  \n  \n_recognizer.StateChanged +=  \n    delegate(object sender, StateChangedEventArgs eventArgs) {  \n        _recognizerStateLabel.Text = \"Speech Recognizer State: \" + eventArgs.RecognizerState.ToString();  \n    };  \n  \n```"
