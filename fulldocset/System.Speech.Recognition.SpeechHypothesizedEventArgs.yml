  summary: "Returns notification from <see cref=&quot;E:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.SpeechHypothesized&quot;></see> or <see cref=&quot;E:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.SpeechHypothesized&quot;></see> events.       This class supports the .NET Framework infrastructure and is not intended to be used directly from application code."
  remarks: "A `SpeechHypothesized` event is raised by the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer> and <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine> classes.       You can obtain detailed information about a tentatively recognized phrase by using the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognitionEventArgs.Result%2A> property.       Numerous `SpeechHypothesized` events are generated as a recognition engine attempts to identify an input phrase. Typically, handling these events is useful only for debugging.       `SpeechHypothesizedEventArgs` derives from <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognitionEventArgs>."
  example:
  - "The example below creates a handler for <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.SpeechHypothesized?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.SpeechHypothesized?displayProperty=fullName> events. The handler uses an instance of `SpeechHypothesizedEventArgs` to return and display information about a tentatively recognized phrase.  \n  \n```  \n// Create a handler for the SpeechHypothesized event.  \nrecognizer.SpeechHypothesized += new EventHandler<SpeechHypothesizedEventArgs>(recognizer_SpeechHypothesized);  \n  \n// Handle the event and display the hypothesized result.  \nvoid recognizer_SpeechHypothesized (object sender, SpeechHypothesizedEventArgs e)  \n  {  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Hypothesized text: \" + e.Result.Text);  \n  }  \n  \n```"
