  remarks: "> [!NOTE] >  [!INCLUDE[DeprecatedContent](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)]       Workflow events are associated with a workflow instance. A WorkflowEventArgs contains the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowInstance> associated with the workflow event. A WorkflowEventArgs or an object that derives from the WorkflowEventArgs class provides the data for all of the workflow events in the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowRuntime> class. WorkflowEventArgs is the base class for <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowCompletedEventArgs>, <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowSuspendedEventArgs>, and <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowTerminatedEventArgs>."
  example:
  - "The following code example demonstrates how to obtain a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowInstance> object using the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowEventArgs.WorkflowInstance%2A> property when an event handler method is called. When the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowRuntime.WorkflowIdled> event occurs, the `OnWorkflowIdled` method defined in this example is called. It determines which workflow is idled using the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowEventArgs.WorkflowInstance%2A> property and then gets a collection of queued items for the workflow instance by calling the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowInstance.GetWorkflowQueueData%2A> method. The code iterates over the collection to determine which activity is waiting for the event that idled the workflow. It then sends an exception to the workflow queue using the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowInstance.EnqueueItem%2A> method along with the name of the event queue item.  \n  \n This code example is part of the Canceling a Workflow SDK Sample from the Program.cs file.
