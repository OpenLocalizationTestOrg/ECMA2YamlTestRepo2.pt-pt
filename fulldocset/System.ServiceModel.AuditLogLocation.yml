  summary: "Specifies the location where security-related event logs are written."
  remarks: "When creating a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](~/add/includes/indigo1-md.md)] application that requires authentication and/or authorization of callers, you can specify that events related to security be recorded for either success, failure, or both. The location of the log is determined by this enumeration.  \n  \n The level of the audit log is specified by setting the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior.MessageAuthenticationAuditLevel%2A> or the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior.ServiceAuthorizationAuditLevel%2A> property of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior> class to one of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.AuditLevel> values.  \n  \n You can also specify audit behavior using the [\\<serviceSecurityAudit>](../Topic/%3CserviceSecurityAudit%3E.md) binding.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  If the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior.AuditLogLocation%2A> property is set to Security and `Audit Object Access` is not set in the `Local Security Policy`, audit events will not be written to the Security log. No failure is returned, but audit entries will not be written to the Security log. In addition, the calling thread must have `SeAuditPrivilege` to be able to write to the Security log.  \n  \n## Default Dependent on Operating System  \n When setting the property to the Default value, the operating system determines which log will actually be written to. For more information, see [Auditing](../Topic/Auditing%20Security%20Events.md)."
  example:
  - "The following example sets the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior.AuditLogLocation%2A> property to one of the AuditLogLocation values.  \n  \n [!code-cs[AuditingSecurityEvents#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.servicemodel.au_0_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[AuditingSecurityEvents#1](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.servicemodel.au_0_1.vb)]"
