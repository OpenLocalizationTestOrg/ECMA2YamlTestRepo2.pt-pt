  summary: "Represents the method implemented by the UI Automation client application to handle an event raised by a UI Automation provider."
  remarks: "Use an AutomationEventHandler delegate to specify the method that is called by a client to handle [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] events.       The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement> represented by `sender` might not have any cached properties or patterns, depending on whether the application subscribed to this event while a <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest> was active."
  example:
  - "The following example shows how to subscribe to and handle an event.  \n  \n [!code-vb[UIAClient_snip#101](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/UIAClient_snip/ClientForm.vb#101)]\n [!code-cs[UIAClient_snip#101](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/CustomElementClient/ClientForm.cs#101)]"
