  summary: "Specifies the types of acknowledgment message that Message Queuing returns to the sending application."
  remarks: "The AcknowledgeTypes class provides a set of flags that you can combine to request one or more categories of acknowledgment messages.       When an application sends a message, it can request that Message Queuing return acknowledgment messages indicating the success or failure of the original message. Message Queuing sends these acknowledgment messages to the administration queue you specify. Acknowledgment types can be divided broadly into four groups: positive arrival acknowledgments, positive read acknowledgments, negative arrival acknowledgments, and negative read acknowledgments. Requesting acknowledgments enables your application to receive notification of certain occurrencesâ€”for example, a message reaching its destination queue, a message being retrieved, or a time-out preventing a message from reaching or being retrieved from the destination queue.       When you are using the <xref:System.Messaging.Message> class to send messages to a queue, you specify the types of acknowledgments your application should receive in the <xref:System.Messaging.Message.AcknowledgeType%2A> property, as well as the administration queue that receives the acknowledgment messages in the <xref:System.Messaging.Message.AdministrationQueue%2A> property.       When you use the <xref:System.Messaging.Message> class to read acknowledgment messages in the administration queue, the instance&quot;s <xref:System.Messaging.Message.Acknowledgment%2A> property indicates the condition responsible for the acknowledgment message, for example, if a time-out expired before the original message was read from the queue."
  example:
  - "The following code example sends and receives a message that contains an order to and from a queue. It specifically requests a positive acknowledgment when the original message reaches or is retrieved from the queue.  \n  \n [!code-cs[Message.Acknowledgment#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.messaging.ackno_1_1.cs)]\n [!code-cpp[Message.Acknowledgment#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.messaging.ackno_1_1.cpp)]\n [!code-vb[Message.Acknowledgment#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.messaging.ackno_1_1.vb)]"
