  summary: "Represents the abstract base class from which the workflow runtime engine core services are derived."
  remarks: "> [!NOTE] >  [!INCLUDE[DeprecatedContent](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md)]       Services that derive from the WorkflowRuntimeService class can be started and stopped by the workflow runtime engine. The order in which the services are started or stopped, however, is indeterminate, and services may require the support of other services in order to properly initialize themselves when they are started, and, conversely, may require the to support of other services in order to properly shut down when they are stopped. To address this problem, the workflow runtime engine provides two-phase mechanisms for starting and stopping services. When <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowRuntime.StartRuntime%2A> is called, the workflow runtime engine invokes the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.WorkflowRuntimeService.Start%2A> method for each of its services that derive from the WorkflowRuntimeService class.  After all of these services have been started, the workflow runtime engine raises the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowRuntime.Started?displayProperty=fullName> event, which causes the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.WorkflowRuntimeService.OnStarted%2A> method to be invoked for each workflow runtime engine service. Your service can override the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.WorkflowRuntimeService.OnStarted%2A> method to participate in this two phase process. Similarly, when <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowRuntime.StopRuntime%2A> is called, the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.WorkflowRuntimeService.Stop%2A> method, the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowRuntime.Stopped?displayProperty=fullName> event, and the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.WorkflowRuntimeService.OnStopped%2A> method provide this two-phase mechanism.  The State property contains a <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.WorkflowRuntimeServiceState> value that indicates whether the service is in the process of starting or stopping or is completely started or stopped.       Services that derive from the WorkflowRuntimeService class can raise the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowRuntime.ServicesExceptionNotHandled?displayProperty=fullName> event when they encounter a condition that causes an unhandled exception by calling <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.WorkflowRuntimeService.RaiseServicesExceptionNotHandledEvent%2A>.       Services derived from the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.WorkflowSchedulerService> class, the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.WorkflowCommitWorkBatchService> class, the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.WorkflowPersistenceService> class, and the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingService> class ultimately derives from the WorkflowRuntimeService class."
