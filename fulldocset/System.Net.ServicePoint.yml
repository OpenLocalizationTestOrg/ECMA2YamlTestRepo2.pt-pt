  summary: "Provides connection management for HTTP connections."
  remarks: "The ServicePoint class handles connections to an Internet resource based on the host information passed in the resource&quot;s Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). The initial connection to the resource determines the information that the ServicePoint object maintains, which is then shared by all subsequent requests to that resource.       ServicePoint objects are managed by the <xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager> class and are created, if necessary, by the <xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager.FindServicePoint%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. ServicePoint objects are never created directly but are always created and managed by the <xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager> class. The maximum number of ServicePoint objects that can be created is set by the <xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager.MaxServicePoints%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.       Each ServicePoint object maintains its connection to an Internet resource until it has been idle longer than the time specified in the <xref:System.Net.ServicePoint.MaxIdleTime%2A> property. When a ServicePoint exceeds the <xref:System.Net.ServicePoint.MaxIdleTime%2A> value, it can be recycled to another connection. The default value of <xref:System.Net.ServicePoint.MaxIdleTime%2A> is set by the <xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager.MaxServicePointIdleTime%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.       When the <xref:System.Net.ServicePoint.ConnectionLeaseTimeout%2A> property is set to a value other than -1, and after the specified time elapses, an active ServicePoint connection is closed after it services the next request. This is useful for applications that do not require active connections that are opened indefinitely, as they are by default.      > [!NOTE] >  In high load conditions, some applications may run out of free threads in the ThreadPool, which may lead to poor system performance (such as high and variable transaction times). See [http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/dnpag/html/scalenetchapt17.asp](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/dnpag/html/scalenetchapt17.asp) for a number of configuration changes you can make to fix this issue."

  remarks: "When this property is set to `true`, client requests that use the `POST` method expect to receive a 100-Continue response from the server to indicate that the client should send the data to be posted. This mechanism allows clients to avoid sending large amounts of data over the network when the server, based on the request headers, intends to reject the request.       For example, assume the Expect100Continue property is `false`. When the request is sent to the server, it includes the data. If, after reading the request headers, the server requires authentication and sends a 401 response, the client must resend the data with proper authentication headers.       If the Expect100Continue property is `true`, the request headers are sent to the server. If the server has not rejected the request, it sends a 100-Continue response signaling that the data can be transmitted. If, as in the preceding example, the server requires authentication, it sends the 401 response and the client has not unnecessarily transmitted the data.       Changing the value of this property does not affect existing connections. Only new connections created after the change are affected.

  remarks: "An application can request that a TCP/IP provider enable the use of keep-alive packets on a TCP connection. The default is that the use of keep-alive packets on a TCP connection is disabled.       The default settings when a TCP socket is initialized sets the keep-alive timeout to 2 hours and the keep-alive interval to 1 second.

The `keepAliveInterval` parameter specifies the interval, in milliseconds, between when successive keep-alive packets are sent if no acknowledgement is received. The number of keep-alive probes cannot be changed and is set to 10.       If a TCP connection is dropped as the result of keep-alives, a <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketError> of <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketError> is returned to any calls in progress on the socket, and any subsequent calls will fail with a <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketError> of <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketError>."
