  summary: "Represents the method that will handle keyboard-related routed events."
  remarks: "No existing keyboard event in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] uses the KeyboardEventHandler delegate. KeyboardEventHandler uses the <xref:System.Windows.Input.KeyboardEventArgs> base class as its event data class. <xref:System.Windows.Input.KeyboardEventArgs> serves as the base class for the more specific <xref:System.Windows.Input.KeyEventArgs> and <xref:System.Windows.Input.KeyboardFocusChangedEventArgs> event data classes. These event data classes are used by the <xref:System.Windows.Input.KeyEventHandler> and <xref:System.Windows.Input.KeyboardFocusChangedEventHandler> delegates, and those delegates are used by existing [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/add/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] events such as <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.KeyDown?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.LostKeyboardFocus?displayProperty=fullName>."
