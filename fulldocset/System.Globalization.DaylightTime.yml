  summary: "Defines the period of daylight saving time."
  remarks: "Daylight saving time is a period during the year when the clock is advanced, usually by an hour, to take advantage of extended daylight hours. At the end of the period, the clock is set back to the standard time.      > [!WARNING] >  The DaylightTime object returned by the <xref:System.TimeZone.GetDaylightChanges%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method recognizes only the time zone adjustment rule that is currently in effect, and ignores any previous adjustment rules for which the system has information. Instead, it applies the current adjustment rule backward in time to periods when it may not have been in effect. To retrieve information about all the known adjustment rules for a particular time zone, use the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.GetAdjustmentRules%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method."
